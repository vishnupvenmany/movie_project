2
00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:10,449
Okay, hold on,
don't shoot.

3
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:12,584
- You see where you're going?
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:13,518
Okay.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,656
Now, let's worry
about how you get there.

6
00:00:16,356 --> 00:00:18,290
Gotta move
your foot here.

7
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:20,093
Point your toe this way.

8
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:21,893
Your hips here.

9
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:23,363
Okay?

10
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:25,430
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:26,565
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:28,100
How about now?
Can you see now?

13
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:29,634
- No.
- How about now?

14
00:00:31,705 --> 00:00:32,773
All right.

15
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:35,442
Ready? Three fingers.

16
00:00:36,043 --> 00:00:37,343
Nice!

17
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:40,412
Nice throw, kiddo.

18
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:41,780
Here you go.

19
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:44,149
Hey, you guys
want mayo? Or mustard?

20
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:45,951
Or both?

21
00:00:45,953 --> 00:00:48,053
Who puts mayo
on a hot dog?

22
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:49,154
Probably your brothers.

23
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:51,288
Uh, two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

24
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,858
Got it!

25
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,494
Nate, mayo or mustard?

26
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:56,560
How about ketchup?

27
00:00:56,562 --> 00:00:58,964
Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

28
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,033
Mind your elbow.

29
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:04,202
Good job, hawk-eye.

30
00:01:04,204 --> 00:01:06,974
Go get your arrow.

31
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:10,208
Hey, guys!

32
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,710
Enough practice.
Soup's on!

33
00:01:12,712 --> 00:01:13,677
All right.

34
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:15,314
We're coming.
We're hungry.

35
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:17,817
Lila, let's go.

36
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:22,054
Lila?

37
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:25,992
Honey?

38
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:30,963
Hey, babe?

39
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:41,874
Babe?

40
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,343
Babe?

41
00:01:46,112 --> 00:01:48,014
Boys!

42
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:50,817
Boys!

43
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:54,317
Laura!

44
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:39,662
You don't need
to do that.

45
00:02:39,664 --> 00:02:42,600
Because, uh, you're just
holding the position.

46
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:45,001
Oh, yeah.

47
00:02:45,003 --> 00:02:47,704
That was close.

48
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,638
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

49
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,142
I would like to try again.

50
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,045
We're tied up.
Feel the tension?

51
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:57,613
It's fun.

52
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:59,817
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

53
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,020
And you've won.

54
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:04,354
Congratulations.

55
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:05,656
Fair game.

56
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:08,425
Good sport.

57
00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:10,728
You have fun?

58
00:03:12,396 --> 00:03:14,531
It was fun.

59
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:38,656
This thing on?

60
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,793
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

61
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:46,762
If you find this recording...

62
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:49,630
don't post it on social media.

63
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,934
It's gonna be
a real tearjerker.

64
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,602
I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.

65
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:57,272
I don't even know
if you're still...

66
00:03:57,274 --> 00:03:59,176
Oh, God, I hope so.

67
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:02,377
<i>Today's day 21.</i>

68
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:05,113
<i>No, uh, 22.</i>

69
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:07,882
<i>You know, if it wasn't for
the existential terror...</i>

70
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:10,084
<i>of staring into
the literal void of space,</i>

71
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:12,620
<i>I'd say I'm feeling
a little better today.</i>

72
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:13,988
<i>Infection's run its course,</i>

73
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,291
<i>thanks to
the Blue Meanie back there.</i>

74
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:18,092
<i>Oh, you'd love her.</i>

75
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:19,794
<i>Very practical.</i>

76
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:22,065
<i>Only a tiny bit sadistic.</i>

77
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:29,070
<i>So, the fuel cells were
cracked during battle...</i>

78
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:31,339
<i>and we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...</i>

79
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:34,509
<i>and bought ourselves about
48 hours of flight time.</i>

80
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:39,546
<i>Uh, but it's now dead
in the water.</i>

81
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:43,152
<i>Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.</i>

82
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:47,056
<i>Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning...</i>

83
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,193
<i>and that'll be it.</i>

84
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:56,629
<i>Pep, I know I said
no more surprises...</i>

85
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,466
<i>but I gotta say
I was really hoping</i>

86
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:00,434
<i>to pull off one last one.</i>

87
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:02,535
<i>But it looks like...</i>

88
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:04,573
<i>Well, you know
what it looks like.</i>

89
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:07,707
Don't feel bad about this.

90
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:11,345
I mean, actually, if you
grovel for a couple weeks...

91
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:14,649
and then move on
with enormous guilt...

92
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:21,621
I should probably lie down
for a minute.

93
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:23,792
Go rest my eyes.

94
00:05:26,595 --> 00:05:29,195
Please know...

95
00:05:29,197 --> 00:05:33,233
when I drift off, it'll be
like every night lately.

96
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:36,204
I'm fine. Totally fine.

97
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:38,173
I dream about you.

98
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,309
Because it's always you.

99
00:09:03,941 --> 00:09:05,274
Couldn't stop him.

100
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:06,408
Neither could I.

101
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,745
Hang on.

102
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,749
I lost the kid.

103
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:15,853
Tony, we lost.

104
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:19,090
Is, uh...?

105
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,792
- Oh, good.
- Oh, my God!

106
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:24,328
Oh, my God!

107
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,934
It's okay.

108
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,510
It's been 23 days
since Thanos came to Earth.

109
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:44,580
World governments
are in pieces.

110
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:46,548
The parts that are
still working...

111
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,321
...are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

112
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:54,723
He did exactly what he said
he was gonna do.

113
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:55,992
Thanos wiped out...

114
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:01,464
...50% of all
living creatures.

115
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:07,802
Where is he now? Where?

116
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:09,504
We don't know.

117
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:12,976
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

118
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:16,513
What's wrong with him?

119
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,681
Oh, he's pissed.

120
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:21,151
He thinks he failed.

121
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,651
Which, of course, he did...

122
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:25,886
but there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

123
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:27,288
Honestly,
until this exact second

124
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,723
I thought you were
a Build-A-Bear.

125
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:30,124
Maybe I am.

126
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:31,759
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

127
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:33,960
Deep space scans...

128
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:36,132
and satellites,
and we got nothing.

129
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:38,832
Tony, you fought him.

130
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,035
Who told you that?

131
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,736
I didn't fight him.

132
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:43,338
No, he wiped my face
with a planet...

133
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,739
while the Bleecker Street
magician

134
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:46,006
gave away the store.

135
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:47,240
That's what happened.

136
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:48,576
There was no fight,
'cause he's not beatable.

137
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:51,446
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

138
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:52,981
Uh...

139
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:55,916
I saw this coming
a few years back.

140
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:58,018
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

141
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,721
Thought I was dreaming.

142
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:00,854
Tony, I'm gonna
need you to focus.

143
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:02,790
And I needed you.

144
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:03,990
As in, past tense.

145
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:07,494
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

146
00:11:07,496 --> 00:11:09,162
Sorry.

147
00:11:09,164 --> 00:11:12,866
You know what I need?
I need a shave.

148
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:15,469
And I believe I remember
telling all youse...

149
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:16,436
Tony, Tony!

150
00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:20,006
...alive and otherwise,
that what we needed

151
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:21,975
was a suit of armor
around the world.

152
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:23,210
Remember that?

153
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:25,846
Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.

154
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:27,180
That's what we needed.

155
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:28,548
Well, that didn't
work out, did it?

156
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,015
I said we'd lose.

157
00:11:30,017 --> 00:11:32,786
You said, "We'll do that
together, too."

158
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:34,187
And guess what, Cap?

159
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:35,789
We lost.

160
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:36,991
And you weren't there.

161
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,559
But that's what
we do, right?

162
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:42,462
Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."

163
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:44,765
We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."

164
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,898
- Okay.
- Right?

165
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,166
You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

166
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:48,468
Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?

167
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,935
- She's great by the way.
- Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

168
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:51,571
We need you.
You're new blood.

169
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:54,775
Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, Cap.

170
00:11:54,777 --> 00:11:56,142
I got no coordinates...

171
00:11:56,144 --> 00:11:59,078
no clues, no strategies,
no options.

172
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,980
Zero. Zip. Nada.

173
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:02,984
No trust, liar.

174
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:08,754
Here, take this.

175
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:11,058
You find him,
you put that on...

176
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:13,060
you hide.

177
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:16,195
- Tony!
- I'm fine.

178
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:17,965
Let me...

179
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:25,571
Bruce gave him
a sedative.

180
00:12:25,573 --> 00:12:27,508
He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.

181
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:30,074
You guys
take care of him...

182
00:12:30,076 --> 00:12:31,712
and I'll bring him a Xorrian
elixir when I come back.

183
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,512
Where are you going?

184
00:12:33,514 --> 00:12:35,248
To kill Thanos.

185
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:39,317
Hey.

186
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:41,554
You know, we usually work
as a team here...

187
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:43,422
and, uh, between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.

188
00:12:43,424 --> 00:12:46,024
We realize up there
is more your territory,

189
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:47,225
but this is
our fight, too.

190
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:48,694
You even know
where he is?

191
00:12:48,696 --> 00:12:49,961
I know people who might.

192
00:12:49,963 --> 00:12:51,431
Don't bother.

193
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,201
I can tell you
where Thanos is.

194
00:12:56,436 --> 00:13:00,104
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

195
00:13:00,106 --> 00:13:04,275
And when he worked,
he talked about his Great Plan.

196
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:07,679
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

197
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:09,447
I'd ask...

198
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:12,784
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

199
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:14,988
And his answer
was always the same.

200
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,492
"To the Garden."

201
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:23,595
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

202
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:25,263
So, where is he?

203
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:27,499
When Thanos snapped
his fingers...

204
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:29,767
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

205
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:31,736
of ridiculously
cosmic proportions.

206
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:34,037
No one's ever seen
anything like it.

207
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,509
Until two days ago...

208
00:13:37,377 --> 00:13:39,044
on this planet.

209
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:41,213
Thanos is there.

210
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:44,749
He used the stones again.

211
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:46,416
Hey, hey, hey.

212
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:48,519
We'd be going in
shorthanded, you know?

213
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:50,153
Look, he's still
got the stones, so...

214
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:51,923
So, let's get 'em.

215
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:53,557
Use them to bring
everyone back.

216
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,759
Just like that?

217
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:56,360
Yeah. Just like that.

218
00:13:56,362 --> 00:13:59,630
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

219
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:02,733
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

220
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:04,301
If we do this,
how do we know

221
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,837
it's gonna end any differently
than it did before?

222
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,541
Because before
you didn't have me.

223
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:10,507
Hey, new girl?

224
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:14,111
Everybody in this room
is about that superhero life.

225
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:15,279
And if you don't mind
my asking,

226
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:16,547
where the hell
have you been all this time?

227
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:18,715
There are a lot of other
planets in the universe.

228
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:21,820
And unfortunately,
they didn't have you guys.

229
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,609
I like this one.

230
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:50,615
Let's go get
this son of a bitch.

231
00:15:12,437 --> 00:15:13,769
Okay.

232
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:16,274
Who here hasn't been
to space?

233
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,608
Why?

234
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,676
You better not throw up
on my ship.

235
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:22,112
Approaching jump in three...

236
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:24,315
two, one.

237
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,529
<i>I'll head down for recon.</i>

238
00:15:57,949 --> 00:15:59,614
This is gonna work, Steve.

239
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:01,284
I know it will.

240
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,656
'Cause I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

241
00:16:07,658 --> 00:16:11,393
<i>No satellites.
No ships. No armies.</i>

242
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:13,196
<i>No ground defenses
of any kind.</i>

243
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:16,800
<i>It's just him.</i>

244
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,302
And that's enough.

245
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:49,524
Oh, no.

246
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:00,700
Where are they?

247
00:18:00,702 --> 00:18:02,704
Answer the question.

248
00:18:05,073 --> 00:18:07,573
The universe
required correction.

249
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:11,711
After that, the stones
served no purpose...

250
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:13,346
beyond temptation.

251
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:16,281
You murdered trillions!

252
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:18,720
You should be grateful.

253
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:24,190
Where are the stones?

254
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:25,825
Gone.

255
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:27,425
Reduced to atoms.

256
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:29,162
You used them two days ago!

257
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:32,533
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

258
00:18:33,134 --> 00:18:34,836
It nearly killed me.

259
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:38,303
But the work is done.

260
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:41,042
It always will be.

261
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:46,014
I am inevitable.

262
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:50,682
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying!

263
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:52,053
My father
is many things.

264
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:55,022
A liar is not one of them.

265
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:58,392
Ah.

266
00:18:59,026 --> 00:19:00,494
Thank you, daughter.

267
00:19:03,197 --> 00:19:05,332
Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.

268
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:12,739
What?

269
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:15,075
What did you do?

270
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,545
I went for the head.

271
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:31,616
<i>So...</i>

272
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:35,386
...I, uh, went on a date
the other day.

273
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:37,254
It's the first time
in five years.

274
00:20:37,256 --> 00:20:39,724
You know? I'm sitting there
at dinner.

275
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:42,894
I didn't even know
what to talk about.

276
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:45,728
What did you talk about?

277
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,201
Eh, same old crap. You know,
how things have changed.

278
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:51,603
My job, his job.

279
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:54,506
How much we miss the Mets.

280
00:20:56,641 --> 00:20:58,476
And then things got quiet...

281
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:04,180
then he cried as they were
serving the salads.

282
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:05,784
What about you?

283
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:10,055
I cried just before dessert.

284
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:15,961
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...

285
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:17,827
That's great.

286
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:19,628
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump.

287
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,432
You didn't know where
you were gonna come down.

288
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:24,400
And that's it.
That's those little

289
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:26,803
brave baby steps
we gotta take...

290
00:21:26,805 --> 00:21:30,774
to try and become whole again,
try and find purpose.

291
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:33,943
I went in the ice in '45,

292
00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:36,647
right after I met
the love of my life.

293
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:39,150
Woke up 70 years later.

294
00:21:42,253 --> 00:21:44,488
You gotta move on.

295
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,759
Gotta move on.

296
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:56,098
The world is in our hands.

297
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,300
It's left to us, guys.

298
00:21:58,302 --> 00:22:00,671
And we gotta do
something with it.

299
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,773
Otherwise...

300
00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:06,276
Thanos should've killed
all of us.

301
00:23:08,237 --> 00:23:09,705
What the hell?

302
00:23:21,918 --> 00:23:23,219
Hope?

303
00:23:56,384 --> 00:23:57,518
Kid!

304
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,753
Hey, kid!

305
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:05,193
What the hell happened here?

306
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,759
Oh, my God!

307
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:43,128
Oh, please!

308
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,696
Please, please!

309
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:46,901
No, no, no. No.

310
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:49,770
No.

311
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,172
Excuse me. Sorry.

312
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:54,541
Oh, Cassie, no.

313
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:56,110
No, no, no.

314
00:24:57,411 --> 00:24:59,912
No, no.

315
00:24:59,914 --> 00:25:03,050
Please, please, please.
No, Cassie.

316
00:25:10,224 --> 00:25:11,358
What?

317
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:42,889
Cassie?

318
00:25:44,023 --> 00:25:45,325
Dad?

319
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,885
You're so big!

320
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:28,266
<i>Yeah. We boarded</i>

321
00:26:28,268 --> 00:26:31,669
<i>that highly-suspect
warship Danvers pinged.</i>

322
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:33,571
<i>It was an infectious
garbage scow.</i>

323
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:35,071
<i>So, thanks
for the hot tip.</i>

324
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:36,474
<i>Well, you were closer.</i>

325
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:38,041
<i>Yeah. And now
we smell like garbage.</i>

326
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,443
You get a reading
on those tremors?

327
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:42,245
<i>'Twas a mild subduction
under the African plate.</i>

328
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:44,615
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

329
00:26:44,617 --> 00:26:46,116
<i>Nat.</i>

330
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:48,218
<i>It's an earthquake
under the ocean.</i>

331
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,888
<i>We handle it
by not handling it.</i>

332
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,557
Carol, are we seeing you
here next month?

333
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,692
<i>Not likely.</i>

334
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:57,460
<i>What? You gonna get
another haircut?</i>

335
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:58,862
<i>Listen, fur face.</i>

336
00:26:58,864 --> 00:27:00,830
<i>I'm covering
a lot of territory.</i>

337
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:02,732
<i>The things that are
happening on Earth</i>

338
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:04,401
<i>are happening
everywhere.</i>

339
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:06,202
<i>On thousands of planets.</i>

340
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:07,870
<i>All right, all right.
That's a good point.</i>

341
00:27:07,872 --> 00:27:09,072
<i>That's a good point.</i>

342
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:11,343
<i>So, you might not see me
for a long time.</i>

343
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,944
All right. Uh, well...

344
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:16,879
This channel's
always active.

345
00:27:16,881 --> 00:27:19,081
So, if anything
goes sideways...

346
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,751
anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

347
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:22,951
comes through me.

348
00:27:22,953 --> 00:27:24,721
<i>Okay.</i>

349
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:26,291
All right.

350
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:28,159
<i>Good luck.</i>

351
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:37,767
Where are you?

352
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:38,901
<i>Mexico.</i>

353
00:27:38,903 --> 00:27:41,738
<i>The Federales found
a room full of bodies.</i>

354
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,372
<i>Looks like a bunch
of cartel guys...</i>

355
00:27:43,374 --> 00:27:45,675
<i>never even had a chance
to get their guns off.</i>

356
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:47,576
It's probably a rival gang.

357
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:48,944
<i>Except it isn't.</i>

358
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:51,680
<i>It's definitely Barton.</i>

359
00:27:51,682 --> 00:27:53,282
<i>What he's done here...</i>

360
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:57,286
<i>what he's been doing
for the last few years...</i>

361
00:27:57,288 --> 00:27:59,323
<i>I mean, the scene
that he left...</i>

362
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:01,423
<i>I gotta tell you,</i>

363
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:03,961
<i>there's a part of me that
doesn't even wanna find him.</i>

364
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:11,635
Will you find out
where he's going next?

365
00:28:15,573 --> 00:28:16,873
<i>Nat?</i>

366
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:20,277
Please?

367
00:28:21,878 --> 00:28:23,213
<i>Okay.</i>

368
00:28:31,655 --> 00:28:33,988
You know, I'd offer
to cook you dinner...

369
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,659
but you seem
pretty miserable already.

370
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,396
You here
to do your laundry?

371
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:43,066
And to see a friend.

372
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:46,669
Clearly, your friend is fine.

373
00:28:49,272 --> 00:28:50,772
You know,
I saw a pod of whales

374
00:28:50,774 --> 00:28:52,006
when I was coming over
the bridge.

375
00:28:52,008 --> 00:28:54,008
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships...

376
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,343
cleaner water.

377
00:28:55,345 --> 00:28:57,512
You know, if you're
about to tell me

378
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:59,647
to look on the bright side...

379
00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:01,017
Um...

380
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:03,151
I'm about to hit you
in the head

381
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:05,520
with a peanut butter sandwich.

382
00:29:05,522 --> 00:29:06,523
Hmm.

383
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:08,689
Sorry.

384
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:10,025
Force of habit.

385
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,640
You know,
I keep telling everybody

386
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:27,608
they should move on...

387
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,211
and grow.

388
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:31,614
Some do.

389
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:36,585
But not us.

390
00:29:37,286 --> 00:29:39,720
If I move on, who does this?

391
00:29:39,722 --> 00:29:42,024
Maybe it doesn't need
to be done.

392
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:48,397
I used to have nothing.

393
00:29:49,531 --> 00:29:51,467
And then I got this.

394
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:55,471
This job.

395
00:29:57,773 --> 00:29:59,575
This family.

396
00:30:05,214 --> 00:30:07,316
And I was better
because of it.

397
00:30:13,322 --> 00:30:17,158
And even though
they're gone...

398
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:23,465
I'm still trying to be better.

399
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,036
I think we both
need to get a life.

400
00:30:31,472 --> 00:30:32,708
You first.

401
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,545
<i>Oh, hi, hi!</i>

402
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:40,847
<i>Uh, is anyone home?</i>

403
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:42,548
<i>This is, uh, Scott Lang.</i>

404
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,751
<i>We met a few years ago
at the airport...</i>

405
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:47,419
<i>in Germany?</i>

406
00:30:47,421 --> 00:30:49,788
<i>I was the guy that got
really big. I had a mask on.</i>

407
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,524
- <i>You wouldn't recognize me.</i>
- Is this an old message?

408
00:30:51,526 --> 00:30:54,827
<i>Ant-Man?
I know you know that.</i>

409
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:56,027
It's the front gate.

410
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:57,563
<i>I really need
to talk to you guys.</i>

411
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:04,772
Scott.

412
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,872
Are you okay?

413
00:31:06,874 --> 00:31:08,074
Yeah.

414
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,344
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

415
00:31:12,346 --> 00:31:14,147
Only to make
conversation.

416
00:31:15,016 --> 00:31:17,016
All right, so...

417
00:31:17,018 --> 00:31:19,787
five years ago,
right before...

418
00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:21,654
Thanos...

419
00:31:21,656 --> 00:31:23,856
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.

420
00:31:23,858 --> 00:31:26,792
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

421
00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:29,028
To get in there,
you have to be incredibly small.

422
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,665
Hope. She's my, um...

423
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:34,501
She was my...

424
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:37,368
She was supposed
to pull me out.

425
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,170
And then Thanos happened...

426
00:31:39,172 --> 00:31:41,272
and I got stuck in there.

427
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,374
I'm sorry, that must have
been a very long five years.

428
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:44,977
Yeah, but that's just it.

429
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:46,244
It wasn't.

430
00:31:46,246 --> 00:31:47,545
For me, it was five hours.

431
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:49,080
See, the rules
of the quantum realm

432
00:31:49,082 --> 00:31:50,214
aren't like
they are up here.

433
00:31:50,216 --> 00:31:51,983
Everything is unpredictable.

434
00:31:51,985 --> 00:31:53,484
Is that anybody's sandwich?

435
00:31:53,486 --> 00:31:54,688
I'm starving.

436
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,187
Scott.

437
00:31:56,189 --> 00:31:57,624
What are you
talking about?

438
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,826
So...

439
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,160
what I'm saying is...

440
00:32:03,162 --> 00:32:05,830
time works differently
in the quantum realm.

441
00:32:05,832 --> 00:32:07,599
The only problem is
right now

442
00:32:07,601 --> 00:32:09,199
we don't have a way
to navigate it.

443
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:11,002
But what if we did?

444
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:12,235
I can't stop thinking
about it.

445
00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:14,304
What if we could somehow
control the chaos...

446
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:15,740
and we could navigate it?

447
00:32:15,742 --> 00:32:17,274
What if there was a way...

448
00:32:17,276 --> 00:32:19,043
that we could enter
the quantum realm

449
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:20,243
at a certain point in time...

450
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:21,879
but then exit
the quantum realm

451
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:23,146
at another point in time?

452
00:32:23,148 --> 00:32:25,215
Like...

453
00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:27,417
- Like before Thanos.
- Wait.

454
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,219
Are you talking
about a time machine?

455
00:32:29,221 --> 00:32:32,155
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

456
00:32:32,157 --> 00:32:33,392
This is more like a...

457
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:37,294
Yeah. Like a time machine.

458
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:39,196
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

459
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:41,565
But I can't stop
thinking about it.

460
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:42,768
There's gotta be...

461
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:44,935
some way...

462
00:32:44,937 --> 00:32:46,903
- It's crazy.
- Scott.

463
00:32:46,905 --> 00:32:48,271
I get emails from a raccoon...

464
00:32:48,273 --> 00:32:51,074
so nothing sounds crazy
anymore.

465
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:53,345
So, who do we talk to
about this?

466
00:33:11,563 --> 00:33:12,631
Chow time!

467
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,234
Maguna.

468
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:21,774
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

469
00:33:22,808 --> 00:33:23,874
<i>Define "lunch"</i>

470
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,276
- <i>or be disintegrated.</i>
- Okay.

471
00:33:26,377 --> 00:33:28,078
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

472
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,645
That is part of a special
anniversary gift

473
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:30,715
I'm making for Mom.

474
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:36,920
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

475
00:33:36,922 --> 00:33:39,188
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

476
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,091
- No.
- That's what you want.

477
00:33:41,093 --> 00:33:43,325
How did you find this?

478
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:45,327
- Garage.
- Really?

479
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:47,532
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

480
00:33:48,232 --> 00:33:50,266
- I found it, though.
- Hmm.

481
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:52,201
You like going in
the garage, huh?

482
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:54,003
So does Daddy.

483
00:33:54,005 --> 00:33:57,274
It's fine, actually.
Mom never wears anything I buy her.

484
00:33:59,844 --> 00:34:01,244
So, I'm gonna...

485
00:34:18,462 --> 00:34:21,163
No. We know
what it sounds like.

486
00:34:21,165 --> 00:34:22,263
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

487
00:34:22,265 --> 00:34:23,565
is anything really
impossible?

488
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:25,633
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

489
00:34:25,635 --> 00:34:27,435
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

490
00:34:27,437 --> 00:34:28,803
Can we agree on that?

491
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:29,972
Thank you.

492
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:32,373
In layman's terms,
it means you're not coming home.

493
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:33,708
- I did.
- No.

494
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,677
You accidentally survived.

495
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,946
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

496
00:34:37,948 --> 00:34:41,418
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

497
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:44,652
A time heist?

498
00:34:44,654 --> 00:34:47,021
Yeah, a time heist.
Of course.

499
00:34:47,023 --> 00:34:48,323
Why didn't we think
of this before?

500
00:34:48,325 --> 00:34:50,959
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

501
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:53,161
The stones are in the past.

502
00:34:53,163 --> 00:34:54,562
We could go back,
we could get them.

503
00:34:54,564 --> 00:34:56,931
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

504
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:59,200
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

505
00:34:59,202 --> 00:35:00,668
I don't believe we would.

506
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,205
Gotta say it. I sometimes
miss that giddy optimism.

507
00:35:04,207 --> 00:35:06,107
However, high hopes
won't help...

508
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:08,143
if there's no logical,
tangible way

509
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:11,646
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

510
00:35:11,648 --> 00:35:13,614
I believe
the most likely outcome

511
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:14,949
will be our
collective demise.

512
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:17,684
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

513
00:35:17,686 --> 00:35:20,487
All right? It means no
talking to our past selves...

514
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:22,257
no betting
on sporting events.

515
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:24,060
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

516
00:35:24,995 --> 00:35:26,360
Are you seriously
telling me

517
00:35:26,362 --> 00:35:28,328
that your plan
to save the universe...

518
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,066
is based on
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

519
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:33,101
- Is it?
- No.

520
00:35:33,103 --> 00:35:34,202
Good. You had me
worried there.

521
00:35:34,204 --> 00:35:35,369
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

522
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:37,938
That's not how
quantum physics works.

523
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,074
Tony.

524
00:35:41,043 --> 00:35:43,143
We have to take a stand.

525
00:35:43,145 --> 00:35:45,047
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

526
00:35:47,316 --> 00:35:49,149
I know you got
a lot on the line.

527
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:51,718
You got a wife, a daughter.

528
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,454
But I lost someone
very important to me.

529
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:56,056
A lotta people did.

530
00:35:56,058 --> 00:35:59,392
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

531
00:35:59,394 --> 00:36:00,594
to bring everyone back,

532
00:36:00,596 --> 00:36:02,262
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

533
00:36:02,264 --> 00:36:04,099
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

534
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:07,201
I can't.

535
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:11,805
Mommy told me
to come and save you.

536
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:14,740
Good job. I'm saved.

537
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:17,044
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

538
00:36:17,046 --> 00:36:18,045
Anything else.

539
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:20,113
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

540
00:36:20,115 --> 00:36:21,480
Oh, look, the table's
set for six.

541
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:23,217
Tony. I get it.

542
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:25,653
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

543
00:36:26,288 --> 00:36:28,454
But this is a second chance.

544
00:36:28,456 --> 00:36:31,124
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

545
00:36:31,126 --> 00:36:32,760
Can't roll the dice on it.

546
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:36,764
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

547
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:41,868
Well, he's scared.

548
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,869
He's not wrong.

549
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:45,171
Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

550
00:36:45,173 --> 00:36:46,608
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

551
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:49,544
No, I wanna do it right.

552
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:54,448
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

553
00:36:55,316 --> 00:36:57,016
Bigger than his?

554
00:36:57,018 --> 00:36:58,951
Come on, I feel like I'm
the only one eating here.

555
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:00,052
Try some of that.

556
00:37:00,054 --> 00:37:01,453
Have some eggs.

557
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:02,822
I'm so confused.

558
00:37:02,824 --> 00:37:04,657
These are confusing times.

559
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,726
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

560
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:09,529
Nah, I get it.
I'm kidding!

561
00:37:09,998 --> 00:37:11,964
I know, it's crazy.

562
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:13,266
I'm wearing shirts now.

563
00:37:13,268 --> 00:37:16,501
Yeah. What? How? Why?

564
00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:19,471
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

565
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:21,307
Except it was worse
for me...

566
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:22,607
'cause I lost twice.

567
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:24,645
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

568
00:37:25,346 --> 00:37:26,678
and then, we all lost.

569
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,214
No one blamed you, Bruce.

570
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:29,716
I did.

571
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:32,584
For years, I've been
treating the Hulk

572
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:33,952
like he's some kind
of disease...

573
00:37:33,954 --> 00:37:35,921
something to get rid of.

574
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:39,325
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

575
00:37:39,327 --> 00:37:41,559
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

576
00:37:41,561 --> 00:37:44,362
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

577
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:45,766
and now, look at me.

578
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,667
Best of both worlds.

579
00:37:48,669 --> 00:37:50,268
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

580
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,070
Can we get a photo?

581
00:37:52,072 --> 00:37:54,205
100%, little person.

582
00:37:54,207 --> 00:37:56,808
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

583
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,877
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

584
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:00,477
Say "green."

585
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,948
- Green.
- Green.

586
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,082
Did you get that?

587
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:05,917
That's a good one.

588
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:08,521
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

589
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:13,857
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

590
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,093
- Nobody does.
- No, he wants you to take

591
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:17,095
- a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.

592
00:38:17,097 --> 00:38:18,029
Stranger danger.

593
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:19,730
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

594
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:20,998
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

595
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,167
But come on. The kid...

596
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:23,634
I don't want a picture
with them.

597
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:24,835
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

598
00:38:24,837 --> 00:38:26,036
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

599
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:27,738
- I don't want to do it.
- We can do it.

600
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,040
- No, you feel bad.
- Take the goddamn phone.

601
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:31,276
Okay.

602
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:32,676
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

603
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,446
No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

604
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:36,080
Hulk out!

605
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:37,116
Bruce.

606
00:38:37,451 --> 00:38:38,716
Dab.

607
00:38:38,718 --> 00:38:40,918
- Bruce.
- Listen to your mom.

608
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,052
She knows better.

609
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:43,921
About what we were saying.

610
00:38:43,923 --> 00:38:45,091
Right.

611
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:49,795
The whole time travel
do-over?

612
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,199
Eh, guys, it's outside
of my area of expertise.

613
00:38:55,201 --> 00:38:57,234
Well, you pulled this off.

614
00:38:57,236 --> 00:39:01,273
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

615
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:36,005
I've got a mild inspiration.

616
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,508
I'd like to see
if it checks out.

617
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,642
So, I'd like to run
one last sim

618
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,444
before we pack it in
for the night.

619
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:44,514
This time, in the shape
of a Mobius strip,

620
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,082
inverted, please.

621
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,152
<i>Processing.</i>

622
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:53,256
Right, give me the eigenvalue
of that particle...

623
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:55,191
factoring in spectral decomp.

624
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:58,194
- That'll take a second.
- <i>Just a moment.</i>

625
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:01,299
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

626
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,367
<i>Model rendered.</i>

627
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:17,447
Shit!

628
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:18,849
Shit!

629
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,586
What are you
doing up, little miss?

630
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,489
- Shit.
- Nope. We don't say that.

631
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:27,789
Only Mommy says that word.

632
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:29,459
She coined it.
It belongs to her.

633
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:30,692
Why are you up?

634
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,194
'Cause I've got some
important shit going on here!

635
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,463
Why do you think?

636
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:34,963
No, I got something
on my mind.

637
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,566
I got something on my mind.

638
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:38,202
Was it juice pops?

639
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:41,004
Sure was.

640
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,272
That's extortion.
That's a word.

641
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:45,540
What kind you want?

642
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:46,675
Great minds think alike.

643
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,745
Juice pops exactly...

644
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,982
was on my mind.

645
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,617
You done? Yeah?

646
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,220
Now you are.

647
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,021
Here. Wipe.

648
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,458
Good. That face
goes there.

649
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,993
Tell me a story.

650
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,394
A story.

651
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:09,197
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed.
The end.

652
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,631
That is a horrible story.

653
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:12,635
Come on, that's
your favorite story.

654
00:41:13,203 --> 00:41:14,338
Love you tons.

655
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,207
I love you 3,000.

656
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:20,410
Wow.

657
00:41:27,683 --> 00:41:30,786
3,000.
That's crazy.

658
00:41:31,754 --> 00:41:33,789
Go to bed or I'll sell
all your toys.

659
00:41:34,757 --> 00:41:36,357
Night night.

660
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:37,925
Not that it's a competition...

661
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:40,194
but she loves me 3,000.

662
00:41:40,196 --> 00:41:41,195
Does she, now?

663
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:44,498
You were somewhere
in the low 6 to 900 range.

664
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:52,573
Whatcha reading?

665
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:54,275
Just a book on composting.

666
00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:56,345
What's new with composting?

667
00:41:57,712 --> 00:41:59,948
- Interesting science...
- I figured it out.

668
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:02,018
By the way.

669
00:42:02,717 --> 00:42:03,950
And, you know,

670
00:42:03,952 --> 00:42:06,353
just so we're talking
about the same thing...

671
00:42:06,355 --> 00:42:07,923
Time travel.

672
00:42:08,324 --> 00:42:09,325
What?

673
00:42:13,496 --> 00:42:14,696
Wow.

674
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:20,202
That's amazing...

675
00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:22,403
and terrifying.

676
00:42:22,405 --> 00:42:23,972
That's right.

677
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:33,112
We got really lucky.

678
00:42:33,114 --> 00:42:34,247
Yeah.

679
00:42:34,249 --> 00:42:35,481
I know.

680
00:42:35,483 --> 00:42:36,749
A lot of people didn't.

681
00:42:36,751 --> 00:42:38,420
Nope. And I can't
help everybody.

682
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:41,621
Sorta seems like you can.

683
00:42:41,623 --> 00:42:43,325
Not if I stop.

684
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:47,362
I can put a pin in it
right now and stop.

685
00:42:48,196 --> 00:42:49,761
Tony...

686
00:42:49,763 --> 00:42:51,331
trying to get you to stop...

687
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:54,236
has been one of the few
failures of my entire life.

688
00:42:58,473 --> 00:43:00,208
Something tells me...

689
00:43:01,443 --> 00:43:02,375
I should put it
in a lockbox

690
00:43:02,377 --> 00:43:04,179
and drop it to the bottom
of the lake...

691
00:43:05,347 --> 00:43:06,514
and go to bed.

692
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,055
But would you be able to rest?

693
00:43:19,427 --> 00:43:23,228
Okay, here we go.
Time travel test number one.

694
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:25,366
Scott, fire up...

695
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,434
the, uh, van thing.

696
00:43:29,671 --> 00:43:30,836
Breakers are set.

697
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:32,838
Emergency generators
are on standby.

698
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,473
Good, because
if we blow the grid,

699
00:43:34,475 --> 00:43:37,909
I don't want to lose, uh,
Tiny here in the 1950s.

700
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:41,013
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.

701
00:43:41,015 --> 00:43:42,981
You can't say things
like that.

702
00:43:42,983 --> 00:43:44,918
It was a bad joke.

703
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,153
You were kidding, right?

704
00:43:48,155 --> 00:43:51,056
I have no idea.
We're talking about time travel here.

705
00:43:51,058 --> 00:43:53,592
Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.

706
00:43:53,594 --> 00:43:55,460
We're good!

707
00:43:55,462 --> 00:43:57,229
Get your helmet on.

708
00:43:57,231 --> 00:43:59,197
Scott, I'm gonna
send you back a week...

709
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:00,965
let you walk around
for an hour,

710
00:44:00,967 --> 00:44:02,701
then bring you back
in 10 seconds.

711
00:44:02,703 --> 00:44:04,436
Make sense?

712
00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:05,771
Perfectly not confusing.

713
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:07,940
Good luck, Scott.
You got this.

714
00:44:09,175 --> 00:44:12,413
You're right.
I do, Captain America.

715
00:44:14,548 --> 00:44:15,946
On a count of three...

716
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:19,917
Three, two, one.

717
00:44:23,256 --> 00:44:25,356
Uh... Guys?

718
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:26,891
This doesn't feel right.

719
00:44:26,893 --> 00:44:27,992
What is this?

720
00:44:27,994 --> 00:44:29,026
- What's going on?
- Who is that?

721
00:44:29,028 --> 00:44:30,294
- Hold on.
- Is that Scott?

722
00:44:30,296 --> 00:44:31,297
Yes, it's Scott.

723
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,767
- What's going on, Bruce?
- Oh, my back!

724
00:44:36,769 --> 00:44:37,835
- What is this?
- Hold on a second.

725
00:44:37,837 --> 00:44:39,003
Could I get
a little space here?

726
00:44:39,005 --> 00:44:40,271
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you bring him back?

727
00:44:40,273 --> 00:44:41,372
I'm working on it.

728
00:44:48,348 --> 00:44:49,280
It's a baby.

729
00:44:49,282 --> 00:44:51,082
- It's Scott.
- As a baby.

730
00:44:51,084 --> 00:44:52,483
- He'll grow.
- Bring Scott back.

731
00:44:52,485 --> 00:44:54,318
When I say kill the power,
kill the power.

732
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,521
Oh, my God.

733
00:44:56,289 --> 00:44:57,590
And... kill it!

734
00:45:01,927 --> 00:45:03,828
Somebody peed my pants.

735
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:04,994
Oh, thank God.

736
00:45:04,996 --> 00:45:08,368
But I don't know
if it was baby me or old me.

737
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:13,606
Or just me me.

738
00:45:13,939 --> 00:45:15,307
Time travel!

739
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:20,112
What?

740
00:45:21,647 --> 00:45:24,049
I see this as an absolute win.

741
00:46:09,594 --> 00:46:10,959
Why the long face?

742
00:46:10,961 --> 00:46:13,962
Let me guess,
he turned into a baby.

743
00:46:13,964 --> 00:46:16,098
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

744
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,267
It's the EPR Paradox.

745
00:46:18,269 --> 00:46:19,535
Instead of pushing Lang
through time,

746
00:46:19,537 --> 00:46:20,636
you might've wound up...

747
00:46:20,638 --> 00:46:22,104
pushing time through Lang.

748
00:46:22,106 --> 00:46:23,272
It's tricky, dangerous.

749
00:46:23,274 --> 00:46:24,973
Somebody could have
cautioned you against it.

750
00:46:24,975 --> 00:46:26,275
You did.

751
00:46:26,277 --> 00:46:27,576
Oh, did I?

752
00:46:27,578 --> 00:46:29,313
Well, thank God
I'm here.

753
00:46:29,947 --> 00:46:31,649
Regardless, I fixed it.

754
00:46:32,516 --> 00:46:35,152
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

755
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:38,422
I just want peace.

756
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:42,693
Turns out resentment
is corrosive, and I hate it.

757
00:46:43,594 --> 00:46:45,095
Me, too.

758
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:47,729
We got a shot
at getting these stones,

759
00:46:47,731 --> 00:46:49,798
but I gotta tell you
my priorities.

760
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,200
Bring back what we lost,
I hope, yes.

761
00:46:52,202 --> 00:46:55,272
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

762
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:59,073
And maybe not die trying.

763
00:46:59,075 --> 00:47:00,310
Would be nice.

764
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,747
Sounds like a deal.

765
00:47:27,237 --> 00:47:28,569
Tony, I don't know.

766
00:47:28,571 --> 00:47:30,204
Why?

767
00:47:30,206 --> 00:47:32,173
He made it for you.

768
00:47:32,175 --> 00:47:34,041
Plus, honestly,
I have to get it out of the garage

769
00:47:34,043 --> 00:47:36,045
before Morgan
takes it sledding.

770
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,585
Thank you, Tony.

771
00:47:43,386 --> 00:47:45,586
Will you keep that
a little quiet?

772
00:47:45,588 --> 00:47:47,290
Didn't bring one
for the whole team.

773
00:47:48,892 --> 00:47:52,259
We are getting
the whole team, yeah?

774
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:54,263
We're working
on that right now.

775
00:48:12,147 --> 00:48:13,814
Hey, Humie.

776
00:48:13,816 --> 00:48:15,917
Where's Big Green?

777
00:48:15,919 --> 00:48:18,153
The kitchen, I think.

778
00:48:19,154 --> 00:48:20,522
That's awesome.

779
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,891
Rhodey,
careful on re-entry.

780
00:48:23,893 --> 00:48:25,661
There's an idiot
in the landing zone.

781
00:48:26,795 --> 00:48:28,361
Oh, God.

782
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,599
<i>What's up,
Regular-Sized Man?</i>

783
00:49:21,282 --> 00:49:23,916
Kind of a step down
from the golden palaces

784
00:49:23,918 --> 00:49:25,618
and the magic hammers
and whatnot.

785
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,252
Hey, have a little
compassion, pal.

786
00:49:27,254 --> 00:49:29,355
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

787
00:49:29,357 --> 00:49:31,123
They're probably just happy
to have a home.

788
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:32,958
You shouldn't have come.

789
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,629
Ah!

790
00:49:34,962 --> 00:49:36,095
Valkyrie!

791
00:49:36,097 --> 00:49:38,797
Great to see you,
angry girl!

792
00:49:38,799 --> 00:49:41,369
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

793
00:49:42,036 --> 00:49:43,102
This is Rocket.

794
00:49:43,104 --> 00:49:44,405
How ya doing?

795
00:49:46,741 --> 00:49:48,007
He won't see you.

796
00:49:48,009 --> 00:49:49,173
It's that bad, huh?

797
00:49:49,175 --> 00:49:50,576
We only see him
once a month

798
00:49:50,578 --> 00:49:53,881
when he comes
in for "supplies."

799
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:56,381
It's that bad.

800
00:49:56,383 --> 00:49:57,384
Yeah.

801
00:50:09,797 --> 00:50:10,896
What the...?

802
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:15,767
Whew! Something died in here!

803
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:19,637
Hello? Thor!

804
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:22,173
Are you here
about the cable?

805
00:50:22,175 --> 00:50:24,742
The Cinemax went out
two weeks ago...

806
00:50:24,744 --> 00:50:27,714
and the sports are all
kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

807
00:50:28,314 --> 00:50:29,516
Thor?

808
00:50:37,257 --> 00:50:40,425
Boys! Oh, my God!

809
00:50:40,427 --> 00:50:43,430
Oh, my God,
it's so good to see you!

810
00:50:44,597 --> 00:50:46,030
Come here,
cuddly little rascal.

811
00:50:46,032 --> 00:50:48,866
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

812
00:50:48,868 --> 00:50:50,300
That's not necessary.

813
00:50:50,302 --> 00:50:53,171
Hulk, you know my friends
Miek and Korg, right?

814
00:50:53,173 --> 00:50:54,404
- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys.

815
00:50:54,406 --> 00:50:55,940
Long time no see.

816
00:50:55,942 --> 00:50:57,008
Beer's in the bucket.

817
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:58,308
Feel free to log on
to the Wi-Fi.

818
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:00,245
No password, obviously.

819
00:51:01,114 --> 00:51:02,646
Thor, he's back.

820
00:51:02,648 --> 00:51:05,584
That kid on the TV just
called me a dickhead again.

821
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:07,185
Noobmaster.

822
00:51:07,187 --> 00:51:09,887
Yeah, NoobMaster69
called me a dickhead.

823
00:51:09,889 --> 00:51:11,956
I am sick of this.

824
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,557
Noobmaster, hey,
it's Thor again.

825
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:14,925
You know,
the God of Thunder.

826
00:51:14,927 --> 00:51:17,294
Listen, bud, if you don't log
off this game immediately...

827
00:51:17,296 --> 00:51:18,795
I am gonna fly over
to your house,

828
00:51:18,797 --> 00:51:20,530
come down to that basement
you're hiding in...

829
00:51:20,532 --> 00:51:23,734
rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!

830
00:51:23,736 --> 00:51:24,668
Oh, that's right, yes!

831
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:26,772
Go cry to your father,
you little weasel.

832
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:28,438
Thank you, Thor.

833
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,073
Let me know if he
bothers you again, okay?

834
00:51:30,075 --> 00:51:31,908
Thank you very much.
I will.

835
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,610
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

836
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:36,613
I've got beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

837
00:51:39,051 --> 00:51:40,517
Buddy.

838
00:51:40,519 --> 00:51:43,220
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Why?

839
00:51:43,222 --> 00:51:44,588
Why, don't I look all right?

840
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,189
You look like
melted ice cream.

841
00:51:47,926 --> 00:51:50,326
So, what's up?
You just here for a hang, or what?

842
00:51:50,328 --> 00:51:52,495
- We need your help.
- Mm.

843
00:51:52,497 --> 00:51:55,065
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

844
00:51:55,067 --> 00:51:56,465
What, like the cable?

845
00:51:56,467 --> 00:51:58,969
'Cause that's been
driving me bananas for weeks.

846
00:51:58,971 --> 00:51:59,972
Like Thanos.

847
00:52:19,124 --> 00:52:22,625
Don't say that name.

848
00:52:22,627 --> 00:52:25,863
Um, yeah, we don't actually
say that name in here.

849
00:52:30,535 --> 00:52:32,637
Please take
your hand off me.

850
00:52:35,973 --> 00:52:39,010
Now, I know that guy...

851
00:52:39,944 --> 00:52:41,177
might scare you.

852
00:52:41,179 --> 00:52:42,611
Why would I be...?

853
00:52:42,613 --> 00:52:45,881
Why would I be scared
of that guy?

854
00:52:45,883 --> 00:52:48,017
I'm the one who killed
that guy, remember?

855
00:52:48,019 --> 00:52:49,218
Hmm.

856
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,321
Anyone else here
kill that guy?

857
00:52:54,658 --> 00:52:55,725
Nope.

858
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,360
Didn't think so.

859
00:52:58,229 --> 00:53:00,162
Korg, why don't you,
uh, tell everybody

860
00:53:00,164 --> 00:53:02,497
who chopped
Thanos' big head off?

861
00:53:02,499 --> 00:53:04,233
Um, Stormbreaker?

862
00:53:04,235 --> 00:53:05,937
Who was swinging
Stormbreaker?

863
00:53:09,806 --> 00:53:12,308
I get it. You're in
a rough spot, okay?

864
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:13,441
I've been there myself.

865
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:16,010
And you want to know
who helped me out of it?

866
00:53:16,012 --> 00:53:18,847
Was it Natasha?

867
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:20,882
It was you.

868
00:53:20,884 --> 00:53:22,853
You helped me.

869
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,589
So, why don't you ask...

870
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:29,057
the Asgardians down there...

871
00:53:29,059 --> 00:53:30,827
how much my help is worth?

872
00:53:36,365 --> 00:53:38,365
The ones that are left,
anyway.

873
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:40,101
I think we could
bring them back.

874
00:53:40,103 --> 00:53:41,972
Stop.

875
00:53:43,073 --> 00:53:44,772
Stop, okay?

876
00:53:44,774 --> 00:53:46,174
I know you think I'm down here

877
00:53:46,176 --> 00:53:47,809
wallowing in my own
self-pity...

878
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:50,577
waiting to be rescued
and saved...

879
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:52,981
but I'm fine, okay.
We're fine, aren't we?

880
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:54,282
Oh, we're
good here, mate.

881
00:53:54,284 --> 00:53:56,583
So, whatever it is that you're
offering, we're not into it.

882
00:53:56,585 --> 00:53:58,319
Don't care.
Couldn't care less.

883
00:53:58,321 --> 00:53:59,588
Goodbye.

884
00:54:02,691 --> 00:54:04,660
We need you, pal.

885
00:54:14,003 --> 00:54:16,005
There's beer on the ship.

886
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:21,744
What kind?

887
00:56:07,748 --> 00:56:11,018
What I
want you can't give me.

888
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:36,076
You shouldn't be here.

889
00:56:38,644 --> 00:56:40,646
Neither should you.

890
00:56:46,453 --> 00:56:48,021
I've got a job to do.

891
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,191
Is that what
you're calling this?

892
00:56:52,259 --> 00:56:53,324
Killing all these people

893
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,794
isn't gonna bring
your family back.

894
00:57:00,467 --> 00:57:01,734
We found something.

895
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,604
A chance, maybe.

896
00:57:07,474 --> 00:57:10,042
Don't.

897
00:57:10,976 --> 00:57:12,344
Don't what?

898
00:57:15,381 --> 00:57:16,949
Don't give me hope.

899
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,788
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

900
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:45,942
You're drifting left.

901
00:57:45,944 --> 00:57:47,912
One side there, Lebowski.

902
00:57:50,882 --> 00:57:52,449
Ratchet, how's it going?

903
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:53,749
It's Rocket.

904
00:57:53,751 --> 00:57:56,320
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.

905
00:58:00,959 --> 00:58:02,827
Time travel suit,
not bad.

906
00:58:03,995 --> 00:58:05,661
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy! Easy!

907
00:58:05,663 --> 00:58:06,796
I'm being very careful.

908
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:08,398
No, you're being very Hulky.

909
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,533
I'm being careful.

910
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,967
These are Pym Particles,
all right?

911
00:58:10,969 --> 00:58:12,436
And ever since
Hank Pym got snapped

912
00:58:12,438 --> 00:58:13,703
out of existence,
this is it.

913
00:58:13,705 --> 00:58:15,638
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

914
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,840
- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.

915
00:58:17,842 --> 00:58:21,144
We've got enough for one
round-trip each. That's it.

916
00:58:21,146 --> 00:58:22,180
No do-overs.

917
00:58:23,214 --> 00:58:24,682
Plus two test runs.

918
00:58:28,486 --> 00:58:29,585
One test run.

919
00:58:30,754 --> 00:58:32,555
All right.
I'm not ready for this.

920
00:58:32,557 --> 00:58:33,992
I'm game.

921
00:58:36,161 --> 00:58:38,461
I'll do it.

922
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,661
Clint,
now you're gonna feel

923
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:41,330
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

924
00:58:41,332 --> 00:58:42,398
Don't worry about that.

925
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,633
Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

926
00:58:43,635 --> 00:58:45,268
If we can do this,
you know...

927
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:48,070
go back in time, why don't
we just find baby Thanos?

928
00:58:48,072 --> 00:58:49,207
You know, and...

929
00:58:52,676 --> 00:58:54,343
First of all,
that's horrible.

930
00:58:54,345 --> 00:58:55,244
It's Thanos.

931
00:58:55,246 --> 00:58:57,613
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

932
00:58:57,615 --> 00:58:59,881
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

933
00:58:59,883 --> 00:59:01,450
Look, we go back,
we get the stones

934
00:59:01,452 --> 00:59:02,784
before Thanos gets them...

935
00:59:02,786 --> 00:59:05,720
Thanos doesn't have
the stones. Problem solved.

936
00:59:05,722 --> 00:59:07,657
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

937
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:08,723
Well, that's what
I heard.

938
00:59:08,725 --> 00:59:09,958
Wait, but who?
Who told you that?

939
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,927
<i>Star Trek,
Terminator, Timecop...</i>

940
00:59:11,929 --> 00:59:13,728
- <i>Time After Time.</i>
- <i>Quantum Leap.</i>

941
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:14,829
<i>Wrinkle in Time,
Somewhere in Time.</i>

942
00:59:14,831 --> 00:59:15,897
<i>Hot Tub Time Machine.</i>

943
00:59:15,899 --> 00:59:16,998
<i>Hot Tub Time Machine.</i>

944
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,333
<i>Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure.</i>

945
00:59:18,335 --> 00:59:20,735
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

946
00:59:20,737 --> 00:59:22,737
<i>Die Hard.</i>
No, that's not one.

947
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:23,905
This is known.

948
00:59:23,907 --> 00:59:25,340
I don't know why
everyone believes that,

949
00:59:25,342 --> 00:59:26,274
but that isn't true.

950
00:59:26,276 --> 00:59:28,577
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

951
00:59:28,579 --> 00:59:30,979
that past becomes
your future...

952
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:34,082
and your former present
becomes the past...

953
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:37,118
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

954
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,752
Exactly.

955
00:59:38,754 --> 00:59:41,857
So <i>Back to the Future</i>
is a bunch of bullshit?

956
00:59:45,596 --> 00:59:47,662
All right, Clint.

957
00:59:47,664 --> 00:59:51,031
We're going in three, two...

958
00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:52,034
one.

959
01:01:04,339 --> 01:01:05,739
Cooper?

960
01:01:05,741 --> 01:01:07,440
Where are my headphones?

961
01:01:07,442 --> 01:01:08,574
Lila?

962
01:01:08,576 --> 01:01:10,678
- I never had them.
- Lila?

963
01:01:11,747 --> 01:01:13,448
Yeah,
you had them yesterday!

964
01:01:13,915 --> 01:01:15,350
Lila! Lila!

965
01:01:20,755 --> 01:01:21,956
Yeah, Dad?

966
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:26,894
Dad?

967
01:01:29,297 --> 01:01:30,563
Lila!

968
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:38,870
Hey. Hey, look at me.

969
01:01:38,872 --> 01:01:40,740
You okay?

970
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:42,976
Yeah. Yeah.

971
01:01:44,713 --> 01:01:46,046
It worked.

972
01:01:47,649 --> 01:01:49,149
It worked.

973
01:01:52,052 --> 01:01:54,454
Okay, so the how works.

974
01:01:54,456 --> 01:01:58,357
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

975
01:01:58,359 --> 01:02:00,325
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

976
01:02:00,327 --> 01:02:02,194
with at least one
of the six Infinity Stones.

977
01:02:02,196 --> 01:02:03,929
Or substitute
the word "encounter"...

978
01:02:03,931 --> 01:02:05,063
for "damn near been killed"

979
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:06,733
by one of the six
Infinity Stones.

980
01:02:06,735 --> 01:02:07,933
Well, I haven't...

981
01:02:07,935 --> 01:02:09,067
but I don't even know

982
01:02:09,069 --> 01:02:10,402
what the hell
you're all talking about.

983
01:02:10,404 --> 01:02:13,572
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

984
01:02:13,574 --> 01:02:15,540
for one round-trip each.

985
01:02:15,542 --> 01:02:16,575
And these stones have been

986
01:02:16,577 --> 01:02:18,844
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

987
01:02:18,846 --> 01:02:20,212
Our history.

988
01:02:20,214 --> 01:02:23,348
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

989
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:25,386
Which means we have
to pick our targets.

990
01:02:25,753 --> 01:02:27,154
Correct.

991
01:02:28,255 --> 01:02:30,054
So, let's start
with the Aether.

992
01:02:30,056 --> 01:02:31,425
Thor, what do you know?

993
01:02:36,896 --> 01:02:38,195
Is he asleep?

994
01:02:38,197 --> 01:02:41,033
No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

995
01:02:43,903 --> 01:02:45,639
Uh, where to start? Um...

996
01:02:47,173 --> 01:02:50,174
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

997
01:02:50,176 --> 01:02:53,177
Someone called it
a stone before.

998
01:02:53,179 --> 01:02:57,682
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

999
01:02:57,684 --> 01:02:59,450
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

1000
01:02:59,452 --> 01:03:00,951
and stop saying that.

1001
01:03:00,953 --> 01:03:03,722
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

1002
01:03:03,724 --> 01:03:05,757
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1003
01:03:05,759 --> 01:03:09,861
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1004
01:03:09,863 --> 01:03:12,396
Ooh.
Scary beings.

1005
01:03:12,398 --> 01:03:14,167
So, Jane, actually...

1006
01:03:14,634 --> 01:03:16,434
Oh, there she is.

1007
01:03:16,436 --> 01:03:20,871
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1008
01:03:20,873 --> 01:03:24,241
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1009
01:03:24,243 --> 01:03:27,645
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1010
01:03:27,647 --> 01:03:29,413
and she became
very, very sick.

1011
01:03:29,415 --> 01:03:31,582
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1012
01:03:31,584 --> 01:03:32,850
which is where I'm from...

1013
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:34,951
and we had to try
and fix her.

1014
01:03:34,953 --> 01:03:36,587
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1015
01:03:36,589 --> 01:03:40,292
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1016
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,596
who's dead and, um...

1017
01:03:44,931 --> 01:03:46,430
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1018
01:03:46,432 --> 01:03:48,599
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1019
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:50,935
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1020
01:03:50,937 --> 01:03:52,235
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1021
01:03:52,237 --> 01:03:54,237
- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.

1022
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:55,940
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1023
01:03:55,942 --> 01:03:57,476
is impermanence.

1024
01:03:58,076 --> 01:04:00,643
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1025
01:04:00,645 --> 01:04:02,612
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1026
01:04:02,614 --> 01:04:05,783
Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

1027
01:04:05,785 --> 01:04:08,753
- Is that a person?
- No, Morag's a planet.

1028
01:04:09,521 --> 01:04:11,421
Quill was a person.

1029
01:04:11,423 --> 01:04:14,023
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1030
01:04:14,025 --> 01:04:15,425
Oh, look.

1031
01:04:15,427 --> 01:04:18,328
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

1032
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:21,798
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

1033
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,101
I'll take you to space.

1034
01:04:24,202 --> 01:04:26,469
Thanos found
the Soul Stone on Vormir.

1035
01:04:26,471 --> 01:04:28,371
What is Vormir?

1036
01:04:28,373 --> 01:04:30,273
A dominion of death...

1037
01:04:30,275 --> 01:04:32,377
at the very center
of celestial existence.

1038
01:04:34,111 --> 01:04:38,315
It's where Thanos
murdered my sister.

1039
01:04:44,656 --> 01:04:45,690
Not it.

1040
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:49,124
- That Time Stone guy.
- Doctor Strange.

1041
01:04:49,126 --> 01:04:51,093
Yeah, what kind
of doctor was he?

1042
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:53,228
Ear-nose-throat
meets rabbit-from-hat.

1043
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:54,764
Nice place
in the Village, though.

1044
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:56,365
Yeah,
on Sullivan Street?

1045
01:04:56,367 --> 01:04:57,699
Mm... Bleecker Street.

1046
01:04:57,701 --> 01:04:59,234
Wait, he lived
in New York?

1047
01:04:59,236 --> 01:05:00,335
No,
he lived in Toronto.

1048
01:05:00,337 --> 01:05:01,436
Uh, yeah, on Bleecker
and Sullivan.

1049
01:05:01,438 --> 01:05:02,704
Have you been listening
to anything?

1050
01:05:02,706 --> 01:05:03,772
Guys.

1051
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:05,374
If you pick
the right year,

1052
01:05:05,376 --> 01:05:07,278
there are three stones
in New York.

1053
01:05:09,647 --> 01:05:11,415
Shut the front door.

1054
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:16,251
All right.
We have a plan.

1055
01:05:16,253 --> 01:05:21,124
Six stones, three teams,
one shot.

1056
01:05:30,501 --> 01:05:32,603
<i>Five years ago,
we lost.</i>

1057
01:05:33,871 --> 01:05:35,305
<i>All of us.</i>

1058
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:38,542
<i>We lost friends.</i>

1059
01:05:39,108 --> 01:05:40,844
<i>We lost family.</i>

1060
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:44,682
<i>We lost a part of ourselves.</i>

1061
01:05:45,849 --> 01:05:48,518
<i>Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.</i>

1062
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:53,387
<i>You know your teams.
You know your missions.</i>

1063
01:05:53,389 --> 01:05:55,525
<i>Get the stones.
Get them back.</i>

1064
01:05:56,192 --> 01:05:57,658
One round-trip each.

1065
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:58,728
No mistakes...

1066
01:05:59,162 --> 01:06:01,029
no do-overs.

1067
01:06:01,031 --> 01:06:02,863
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

1068
01:06:02,865 --> 01:06:05,134
That doesn't mean
we should know what to expect.

1069
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,270
Be careful.

1070
01:06:07,804 --> 01:06:09,205
Look out for each other.

1071
01:06:10,373 --> 01:06:12,408
This is the fight
of our lives...

1072
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:14,777
and we're gonna win.

1073
01:06:16,913 --> 01:06:18,113
Whatever it takes.

1074
01:06:21,116 --> 01:06:22,817
Good luck.

1075
01:06:22,819 --> 01:06:24,018
He's pretty good at that.

1076
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:25,286
- Right?
- All right.

1077
01:06:25,288 --> 01:06:26,354
You heard the man.

1078
01:06:26,356 --> 01:06:27,757
Stroke those keys,
Jolly Green.

1079
01:06:28,524 --> 01:06:30,791
Trackers engaged.

1080
01:06:30,793 --> 01:06:32,994
You promise to bring that
back in one piece, right?

1081
01:06:32,996 --> 01:06:34,595
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1082
01:06:34,597 --> 01:06:36,429
Okay, I'll do my best.

1083
01:06:36,431 --> 01:06:38,467
As promises go,
that was pretty lame.

1084
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,639
See ya in a minute.

1085
01:07:36,992 --> 01:07:38,357
All right, we all have
our assignments.

1086
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:40,694
Two stones uptown,
one stone down.

1087
01:07:40,696 --> 01:07:42,862
Stay low. Keep an eye
on the clock.

1088
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:00,214
Maybe smash a few things
along the way.

1089
01:08:01,116 --> 01:08:03,317
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

1090
01:08:30,711 --> 01:08:32,343
I'd be careful
going that way.

1091
01:08:32,345 --> 01:08:34,247
We just had
the floors waxed.

1092
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:41,021
Yeah, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.

1093
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:46,225
You're about
five years too early.

1094
01:08:46,227 --> 01:08:48,392
Stephen Strange is currently
performing surgery

1095
01:08:48,394 --> 01:08:49,997
about 20 blocks that way.

1096
01:08:51,831 --> 01:08:52,832
What do you want from him?

1097
01:08:53,767 --> 01:08:54,768
That, actually.

1098
01:08:55,735 --> 01:08:56,803
Ah!

1099
01:08:57,937 --> 01:08:59,270
I'm afraid not.

1100
01:08:59,272 --> 01:09:00,774
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1101
01:09:01,508 --> 01:09:02,807
You don't want
to do this.

1102
01:09:02,809 --> 01:09:04,442
Ah, you're right, I don't.
But I need that stone...

1103
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:06,045
and I don't have time
to debate it.

1104
01:09:15,054 --> 01:09:16,723
Let's start over, shall we?

1105
01:09:28,168 --> 01:09:29,700
For you, Lady Jane.

1106
01:09:29,702 --> 01:09:32,335
Um, so you have
anything with pants?

1107
01:09:32,337 --> 01:09:33,671
Pants?

1108
01:09:33,673 --> 01:09:35,706
Never mind.
These will be fine. Thank you.

1109
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:37,609
- Yes, milady.
- Oh, there's Jane.

1110
01:09:39,112 --> 01:09:40,312
All right.

1111
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,114
Here's the deal, tubby.

1112
01:09:43,116 --> 01:09:44,248
You're gonna charm her,

1113
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:45,682
and I'm gonna poke her
with this thing...

1114
01:09:45,684 --> 01:09:48,286
and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

1115
01:09:49,922 --> 01:09:51,088
I'll be right back, okay?

1116
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:52,823
The wine cellar
is just down here.

1117
01:09:52,825 --> 01:09:55,859
My father used to have this
huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1118
01:09:55,861 --> 01:09:57,427
I'll see if the scullery
has a couple of to-go cups.

1119
01:09:57,429 --> 01:09:59,362
Hey. Hey! Aren't you
drunk enough already?

1120
01:10:06,605 --> 01:10:07,871
If you could send Loki
some soup.

1121
01:10:07,873 --> 01:10:08,939
Yes, milady.

1122
01:10:08,941 --> 01:10:09,973
And ask our librarians

1123
01:10:09,975 --> 01:10:12,878
to pull some volumes
from the astronomy shelf.

1124
01:10:19,017 --> 01:10:20,652
Who's the fancy broad?

1125
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,521
That's my mother.

1126
01:10:23,922 --> 01:10:25,691
She dies today.

1127
01:10:26,225 --> 01:10:28,060
Oh, that is today?

1128
01:10:34,498 --> 01:10:37,600
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

1129
01:10:37,602 --> 01:10:39,368
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.

1130
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:40,703
It's a bad idea!

1131
01:10:40,705 --> 01:10:41,871
- Come here.
- No, no, no.

1132
01:10:41,873 --> 01:10:44,473
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

1133
01:10:44,475 --> 01:10:45,541
Come here. Right here.

1134
01:10:45,543 --> 01:10:47,376
I shouldn't be here.
This is bad.

1135
01:10:47,378 --> 01:10:49,212
You think you're the
only one who lost people?

1136
01:10:49,214 --> 01:10:51,214
What do you think
we're doing here?

1137
01:10:51,216 --> 01:10:53,482
I lost the only family
I ever had.

1138
01:10:53,484 --> 01:10:56,152
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

1139
01:10:56,154 --> 01:10:58,255
all gone.

1140
01:10:58,257 --> 01:10:59,955
I get you miss
your mom...

1141
01:10:59,957 --> 01:11:01,258
but she's gone.

1142
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,725
Really gone.

1143
01:11:02,727 --> 01:11:05,928
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

1144
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:07,031
and you can help them.

1145
01:11:08,132 --> 01:11:09,598
So, is it too much to ask

1146
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,433
that you brush the crumbs
out of your beard...

1147
01:11:11,435 --> 01:11:14,036
make schmoopy talk
to Pretty Pants...

1148
01:11:14,038 --> 01:11:17,273
and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone...

1149
01:11:17,275 --> 01:11:18,943
and help me
get my family back?

1150
01:11:20,111 --> 01:11:21,911
Okay.

1151
01:11:21,913 --> 01:11:22,914
Are you crying?

1152
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:24,849
No.

1153
01:11:26,717 --> 01:11:27,783
Yes.

1154
01:11:27,785 --> 01:11:29,285
I feel like
I'm losing it.

1155
01:11:29,287 --> 01:11:30,352
Get it together!

1156
01:11:30,354 --> 01:11:31,419
You can do this.

1157
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:34,025
You can do this.

1158
01:11:37,161 --> 01:11:38,294
All right?

1159
01:11:38,296 --> 01:11:39,427
Yes, I can.

1160
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:40,630
Good.

1161
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:45,069
I can do this. I can do this.

1162
01:11:45,936 --> 01:11:47,435
I can't do this.

1163
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:49,405
All right, heartbreaker,
she's alone.

1164
01:11:49,407 --> 01:11:51,105
This is our shot.

1165
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:53,777
Thor? Thor!

1166
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,421
All right,
bring it down, Blue.

1167
01:12:05,423 --> 01:12:07,958
Right on that line.
That's it. Down, down.

1168
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:14,362
Hey, can we hurry it up?

1169
01:12:14,364 --> 01:12:16,563
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

1170
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:18,567
All that is really helpful.

1171
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,070
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.

1172
01:12:22,072 --> 01:12:25,273
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

1173
01:12:25,275 --> 01:12:26,941
- Hey.
- We got this.

1174
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:28,443
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

1175
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:30,445
I'll see you back.

1176
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:31,915
You guys watch
each other's six.

1177
01:12:32,449 --> 01:12:33,849
Yeah.

1178
01:12:42,392 --> 01:12:44,026
Coordinates
for Vormir are laid in.

1179
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,663
All they have to do
is not fall out.

1180
01:12:53,403 --> 01:12:55,969
We're a long way
from Budapest.

1181
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:03,210
Okay, so, uh...

1182
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,713
we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...

1183
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,784
and then he leads us to the Power
Stone, is that it?

1184
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:11,120
Let's take cover.

1185
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:15,055
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

1186
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,655
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about right now?

1187
01:13:16,657 --> 01:13:18,127
Who else is looking
for these stones?

1188
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:23,296
My father...

1189
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:25,265
my sister...

1190
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:26,500
and me.

1191
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:27,835
And you?

1192
01:13:29,537 --> 01:13:31,206
Where are you right now?

1193
01:13:59,767 --> 01:14:01,233
You're welcome.

1194
01:14:01,235 --> 01:14:04,203
I didn't ask for your help.

1195
01:14:04,205 --> 01:14:05,907
And yet, you always need it.

1196
01:14:09,744 --> 01:14:12,078
Get up. Father wants us
back on the ship.

1197
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,212
Why?

1198
01:14:13,214 --> 01:14:15,216
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1199
01:14:19,619 --> 01:14:21,153
Where?

1200
01:14:21,155 --> 01:14:23,124
On a planet
called Morag.

1201
01:14:24,624 --> 01:14:26,691
Father's plan
is finally in motion.

1202
01:14:26,693 --> 01:14:29,028
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1203
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:30,329
It's a start.

1204
01:14:30,331 --> 01:14:32,166
If he gets all of them...

1205
01:14:44,978 --> 01:14:46,845
Ronan's located
the Power Stone.

1206
01:14:46,847 --> 01:14:48,746
I'm dispatching you
to his ship.

1207
01:14:48,748 --> 01:14:50,248
He won't like that.

1208
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:52,352
His alternative is death.

1209
01:14:53,787 --> 01:14:55,755
Ronan's obsession...

1210
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:58,925
clouds his judgment.

1211
01:15:03,263 --> 01:15:05,098
We will not fail you, Father.

1212
01:15:06,133 --> 01:15:07,834
No, you won't.

1213
01:15:10,403 --> 01:15:11,404
I swear...

1214
01:15:13,306 --> 01:15:15,242
I will make you proud.

1215
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:27,218
<i>...we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...</i>

1216
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:29,554
<i>and then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?</i>

1217
01:15:29,556 --> 01:15:32,022
<i>Let's take cover.</i>

1218
01:15:32,024 --> 01:15:33,924
<i>We're not the only ones
in 2014</i>

1219
01:15:33,926 --> 01:15:35,127
<i>looking for the stones.</i>

1220
01:15:37,464 --> 01:15:38,962
Who was that?

1221
01:15:38,964 --> 01:15:40,097
I don't know.

1222
01:15:40,099 --> 01:15:42,435
My head is splitting.
I don't know.

1223
01:15:43,802 --> 01:15:46,972
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

1224
01:15:47,507 --> 01:15:48,974
Shh.

1225
01:15:57,183 --> 01:15:59,218
Bring her to my ship.

1226
01:16:06,592 --> 01:16:07,925
Better hustle, Cap.

1227
01:16:07,927 --> 01:16:09,660
Things look like they're
just about wrapped up here.

1228
01:16:09,662 --> 01:16:11,830
<i>Got it.
I'm approaching the elevator now.</i>

1229
01:16:18,003 --> 01:16:19,871
If it's all
the same to you...

1230
01:16:21,906 --> 01:16:23,973
I'll have
that drink now.

1231
01:16:23,975 --> 01:16:25,676
All right,
get him on his feet.

1232
01:16:25,678 --> 01:16:28,811
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

1233
01:16:28,813 --> 01:16:30,347
By the way, feel free
to clean up.

1234
01:16:30,349 --> 01:16:33,550
Mr. Rogers,
I almost forgot that that suit...

1235
01:16:33,552 --> 01:16:35,184
did nothing for your ass.

1236
01:16:35,186 --> 01:16:36,752
<i>No one
asked you to look, Tony.</i>

1237
01:16:36,754 --> 01:16:37,887
It's ridiculous.

1238
01:16:37,889 --> 01:16:39,188
<i>I think
you look great, Cap.</i>

1239
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:41,692
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.</i>

1240
01:16:41,694 --> 01:16:43,627
Who gets
the, uh, magic wand?

1241
01:16:43,629 --> 01:16:44,860
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's

1242
01:16:44,862 --> 01:16:46,197
coming to secure it.

1243
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:57,873
We can take that
off your hands.

1244
01:16:57,875 --> 01:16:59,077
By all means.

1245
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:02,979
Careful with that thing.

1246
01:17:02,981 --> 01:17:04,680
Yeah, unless you want
your mind erased.

1247
01:17:04,682 --> 01:17:05,780
And not in a fun way.

1248
01:17:05,782 --> 01:17:06,983
We promise to be careful.

1249
01:17:06,985 --> 01:17:08,284
<i>Who are these guys?</i>

1250
01:17:08,286 --> 01:17:09,452
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1251
01:17:09,454 --> 01:17:12,854
Well, actually Hydra,
but we didn't know that yet.

1252
01:17:12,856 --> 01:17:15,124
<i>Seriously?
You didn't?</i>

1253
01:17:15,126 --> 01:17:16,858
<i>I mean, they look
like bad guys.</i>

1254
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,327
You're small,
but you're talking loud.

1255
01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:20,329
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1256
01:17:20,331 --> 01:17:22,431
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1257
01:17:22,433 --> 01:17:25,334
I mean, honestly,
how do you keep your food down?

1258
01:17:25,336 --> 01:17:27,135
Shut up.

1259
01:17:27,137 --> 01:17:28,704
Ooh. All right, you're up,
little buddy.

1260
01:17:28,706 --> 01:17:30,939
There's our stone.

1261
01:17:30,941 --> 01:17:32,275
<i>All right.</i>

1262
01:17:32,277 --> 01:17:33,411
<i>Flick me.</i>

1263
01:17:47,491 --> 01:17:48,624
- Move.
- Hey.

1264
01:17:48,626 --> 01:17:50,358
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, hey. Buddy!

1265
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:52,460
What do you think?
Maximum occupancy has been reached.

1266
01:17:52,462 --> 01:17:53,663
Take the stairs.

1267
01:17:53,665 --> 01:17:55,397
Yeah. Stop, stop.

1268
01:17:58,168 --> 01:18:01,872
"Take the stairs."
Hate the stairs.

1269
01:18:04,574 --> 01:18:07,409
All right, Cap, I got
our scepter in the elevator...

1270
01:18:07,411 --> 01:18:09,246
just passing the 80th floor.

1271
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,081
On it.

1272
01:18:11,548 --> 01:18:12,747
Head to the lobby.

1273
01:18:12,749 --> 01:18:13,947
<i>All right,
I'll see you there.</i>

1274
01:18:13,949 --> 01:18:15,750
Evidence secure.

1275
01:18:15,752 --> 01:18:17,851
We're en route
to Doctor List.

1276
01:18:17,853 --> 01:18:20,956
No. No hitches at all,
Mr. Secretary.

1277
01:18:26,095 --> 01:18:26,960
Captain.

1278
01:18:26,962 --> 01:18:28,330
I thought
you were coordinating

1279
01:18:28,332 --> 01:18:29,196
search and rescue.

1280
01:18:29,198 --> 01:18:31,033
Change of plans.

1281
01:18:34,705 --> 01:18:36,238
Hey, Cap.

1282
01:18:37,474 --> 01:18:38,508
Rumlow.

1283
01:18:44,748 --> 01:18:46,748
I just got a call
from the secretary.

1284
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:48,851
I'm gonna be running point
on the scepter.

1285
01:18:51,053 --> 01:18:53,456
Sir? I don't understand.

1286
01:18:55,826 --> 01:18:57,826
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

1287
01:18:57,828 --> 01:18:59,626
Sorry, Cap.

1288
01:18:59,628 --> 01:19:01,428
We can't give you
the scepter.

1289
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:03,664
I'm gonna have to call
the director.

1290
01:19:03,666 --> 01:19:05,968
That's okay. Trust me.

1291
01:19:09,372 --> 01:19:10,373
Hail Hydra.

1292
01:19:24,953 --> 01:19:26,919
So many stairs!

1293
01:19:38,433 --> 01:19:41,467
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

1294
01:19:41,469 --> 01:19:42,402
It is go time.

1295
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:43,672
<i>Bombs away.</i>

1296
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,312
<i>Is that Axe Body Spray?</i>

1297
01:19:53,314 --> 01:19:55,815
Yeah, I had a can in the desk
for emergencies. Relax.

1298
01:19:55,817 --> 01:19:57,016
Can we focus, please?

1299
01:19:57,018 --> 01:19:58,420
<i>I'm going inside you...</i>

1300
01:19:59,187 --> 01:20:00,188
<i>now.</i>

1301
01:20:05,894 --> 01:20:07,393
Uh, may I ask you
where you're going?

1302
01:20:07,395 --> 01:20:09,928
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are...?

1303
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,062
Alexander Pierce.

1304
01:20:11,064 --> 01:20:12,565
He's the man
above the folks

1305
01:20:12,567 --> 01:20:13,766
- behind Nick Fury.
- Oh.

1306
01:20:13,768 --> 01:20:15,000
My friends call me
Mr. Secretary.

1307
01:20:15,002 --> 01:20:16,067
I'm gonna have to ask you

1308
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:17,370
to turn that prisoner
over to me.

1309
01:20:17,372 --> 01:20:19,338
Uh, Loki will be answering
to Odin himself.

1310
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,673
No, he's going
to answer to us.

1311
01:20:20,675 --> 01:20:22,040
Odin can have what's left.

1312
01:20:22,042 --> 01:20:23,543
And I'm gonna need
that case.

1313
01:20:23,545 --> 01:20:25,711
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D.
property for over 70 years.

1314
01:20:25,713 --> 01:20:26,978
Hand over the case, Stark.

1315
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:28,246
All right,
move it, Stuart Little.

1316
01:20:28,248 --> 01:20:29,615
Things are getting dicey
out here. Let's go.

1317
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:31,784
I'm not gonna argue who's got
the higher authority here...

1318
01:20:31,786 --> 01:20:33,151
<i>You promise me
you won't die?</i>

1319
01:20:33,153 --> 01:20:36,054
We're only giving me
a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1320
01:20:36,056 --> 01:20:37,857
<i>That doesn't sound mild.</i>

1321
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:39,024
I need the case.

1322
01:20:39,026 --> 01:20:40,358
I know you got a lot of
pull, I'm just saying,

1323
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,894
- jurisdiction...
- Okay, then give me the case.

1324
01:20:41,896 --> 01:20:42,961
Well, jurisdiction...

1325
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,029
Hand it over.

1326
01:20:44,031 --> 01:20:45,096
Do it, Lang!

1327
01:20:45,098 --> 01:20:46,164
Get your hands off me.

1328
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:48,099
Window's closing.
Pull my pin.

1329
01:20:48,101 --> 01:20:49,568
<i>Here goes!</i>

1330
01:20:52,172 --> 01:20:54,007
- Stark?
- Stark?

1331
01:20:55,075 --> 01:20:56,475
He's convulsing.
Give him air!

1332
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:58,677
- Medic!
- Medic!

1333
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:00,278
Give these guys
some help.

1334
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,847
Speak to me.

1335
01:21:01,849 --> 01:21:03,684
Stark,
is it your chest machine?

1336
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:07,754
Breathe, breathe.

1337
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,225
Good job.
Meet me in the alley.

1338
01:21:14,227 --> 01:21:15,429
I'm gonna grab
a quick slice.

1339
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,067
No stairs!

1340
01:21:29,877 --> 01:21:32,243
Uh... Come on, Stark,
stay with us.

1341
01:21:32,245 --> 01:21:33,310
I'm going to
try something. Okay?

1342
01:21:33,312 --> 01:21:35,179
I have no idea
if it's going to work.

1343
01:21:35,181 --> 01:21:37,615
Yes!

1344
01:21:37,617 --> 01:21:39,049
Oh, that worked a treat.

1345
01:21:39,051 --> 01:21:40,184
Dude, that was so crazy.

1346
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:41,820
I had no idea
if that was gonna work.

1347
01:21:41,822 --> 01:21:43,855
- The case.
- The case is, uh...

1348
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:46,058
Where's the case?
Where's Loki?

1349
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,192
Loki!

1350
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:49,560
<i>That wasn't
supposed to happen, was it?</i>

1351
01:21:49,562 --> 01:21:50,694
Oh, we blew it.

1352
01:21:50,696 --> 01:21:52,162
Loki?

1353
01:21:54,133 --> 01:21:55,568
Tony, what's going on?

1354
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:58,304
Tell me you found that Cube.

1355
01:22:01,007 --> 01:22:02,542
Oh, you gotta be
shitting me.

1356
01:22:06,412 --> 01:22:08,913
I have eyes on Loki.
14th floor.

1357
01:22:08,915 --> 01:22:10,416
I'm not Loki...

1358
01:22:13,886 --> 01:22:15,588
and I don't wanna
hurt you.

1359
01:22:24,329 --> 01:22:25,663
I can do this all day.

1360
01:22:25,665 --> 01:22:27,031
Yeah, I know.

1361
01:22:27,033 --> 01:22:28,233
I know.

1362
01:23:00,832 --> 01:23:01,833
Where did you get this?

1363
01:23:13,078 --> 01:23:16,313
Bucky is alive.

1364
01:23:19,751 --> 01:23:20,785
What?

1365
01:23:35,733 --> 01:23:37,368
That is America's ass.

1366
01:23:41,672 --> 01:23:42,604
Please, please.

1367
01:23:42,606 --> 01:23:44,708
I'm sorry,
I can't help you, Bruce.

1368
01:23:45,542 --> 01:23:47,076
If I give up
the Time Stone

1369
01:23:47,078 --> 01:23:48,977
to help your reality,
I'm dooming my own.

1370
01:23:48,979 --> 01:23:50,712
With all due respect,
all right...

1371
01:23:50,714 --> 01:23:54,184
I'm not sure the science
really supports that.

1372
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:01,523
The Infinity Stones create

1373
01:24:01,525 --> 01:24:04,059
what you experience
as the flow of time.

1374
01:24:04,061 --> 01:24:05,827
Remove one of the stones...

1375
01:24:05,829 --> 01:24:08,030
and that flow splits.

1376
01:24:08,032 --> 01:24:10,532
Now, this may benefit
your reality...

1377
01:24:10,534 --> 01:24:13,135
but my new one,
not so much.

1378
01:24:13,137 --> 01:24:15,037
In this new branch reality...

1379
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:16,838
without our chief weapon

1380
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,439
against the forces
of darkness...

1381
01:24:18,441 --> 01:24:20,709
our world would be overrun.

1382
01:24:20,711 --> 01:24:22,610
Millions will suffer.

1383
01:24:22,612 --> 01:24:24,278
So, tell me, Doctor.

1384
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:26,748
Can your science
prevent all that?

1385
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:27,751
No...

1386
01:24:28,752 --> 01:24:29,785
but we can erase it.

1387
01:24:29,787 --> 01:24:31,686
Because once we're done
with the stones...

1388
01:24:31,688 --> 01:24:34,156
we can return each one
to its own timeline...

1389
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:35,891
at the moment it was taken.

1390
01:24:35,893 --> 01:24:38,461
So, chronologically...

1391
01:24:39,295 --> 01:24:40,530
in that reality...

1392
01:24:42,999 --> 01:24:44,734
it never left.

1393
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:50,306
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1394
01:24:53,576 --> 01:24:56,277
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

1395
01:24:56,279 --> 01:24:59,613
We will. I will.
I promise.

1396
01:24:59,615 --> 01:25:01,851
I can't risk this reality
on a promise.

1397
01:25:03,386 --> 01:25:06,252
It's the duty
of the Sorcerer Supreme

1398
01:25:06,254 --> 01:25:08,388
to protect the Time Stone.

1399
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:10,492
Then why the hell
did Strange give it away?

1400
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:13,460
What did you say?

1401
01:25:13,462 --> 01:25:15,932
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

1402
01:25:16,431 --> 01:25:18,300
- Willingly?
- Yes.

1403
01:25:22,038 --> 01:25:23,838
- Why?
- I have no idea.

1404
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,640
Maybe he made a mistake.

1405
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:36,986
Or I did.

1406
01:25:57,205 --> 01:25:59,672
Strange is meant to be
the best of us.

1407
01:25:59,674 --> 01:26:02,477
So, he must've done it
for a reason.

1408
01:26:03,111 --> 01:26:04,813
I fear you might be right.

1409
01:26:09,951 --> 01:26:10,952
Thank you.

1410
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:18,894
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1411
01:26:20,929 --> 01:26:22,296
We all are.

1412
01:26:42,483 --> 01:26:44,318
Run diagnostics.

1413
01:26:44,919 --> 01:26:46,887
Show me her memory file.

1414
01:26:48,355 --> 01:26:50,925
Sire, the file
appears entangled.

1415
01:26:52,059 --> 01:26:54,028
It was a memory,
but not hers.

1416
01:26:55,229 --> 01:26:56,895
There's another
consciousness...

1417
01:26:56,897 --> 01:26:58,331
sharing her network.

1418
01:26:58,766 --> 01:27:00,034
Another Nebula.

1419
01:27:02,136 --> 01:27:03,635
Impossible.

1420
01:27:03,637 --> 01:27:07,272
This duplicate
carries a time stamp...

1421
01:27:07,274 --> 01:27:09,609
from nine years
in the future.

1422
01:27:14,081 --> 01:27:17,216
Where is this other Nebula?

1423
01:27:17,218 --> 01:27:19,419
In our
solar system on Morag.

1424
01:27:20,855 --> 01:27:22,221
Can you access her?

1425
01:27:22,223 --> 01:27:24,388
Yes,
the two are linked.

1426
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:26,591
Search the duplicate's
memories...

1427
01:27:26,593 --> 01:27:28,962
for Infinity Stones.

1428
01:27:32,398 --> 01:27:33,731
<i>And these stones have been</i>

1429
01:27:33,733 --> 01:27:35,499
<i>in a lot of different places
throughout history.</i>

1430
01:27:35,501 --> 01:27:36,634
<i>Our history.</i>

1431
01:27:36,636 --> 01:27:39,070
<i>So, not a lot
of convenient spots</i>

1432
01:27:39,072 --> 01:27:40,205
<i>to just drop in.</i>

1433
01:27:40,207 --> 01:27:41,973
<i>Which means
we have to pick our targets.</i>

1434
01:27:41,975 --> 01:27:43,610
- <i>Correct.</i>
- Freeze image.

1435
01:27:45,378 --> 01:27:46,746
Terrans.

1436
01:27:47,814 --> 01:27:49,549
Avengers.

1437
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:52,316
Unruly wretches.

1438
01:27:52,318 --> 01:27:53,920
What's that reflection?

1439
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:56,756
Amplify this, Maw.

1440
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:01,526
I don't understand.

1441
01:28:06,099 --> 01:28:07,698
Two Nebulas.

1442
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,435
No.
The same Nebula...

1443
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:12,872
from two different times.

1444
01:28:14,107 --> 01:28:15,772
Set course for Morag.

1445
01:28:15,774 --> 01:28:18,443
And scan
the duplicate's memories.

1446
01:28:19,045 --> 01:28:21,546
I wanna see everything.

1447
01:28:31,257 --> 01:28:33,291
My ladies,
I'll see you after.

1448
01:28:33,293 --> 01:28:34,826
I'll see you after.
Go on ahead.

1449
01:28:49,141 --> 01:28:50,206
What are you doing?

1450
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,943
Oh, God!

1451
01:28:52,945 --> 01:28:55,612
You're better off leaving
the sneaking to your brother.

1452
01:28:55,614 --> 01:28:57,647
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

1453
01:28:57,649 --> 01:28:59,049
What are you wearing?

1454
01:28:59,051 --> 01:29:01,617
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

1455
01:29:04,522 --> 01:29:05,621
Mm...

1456
01:29:05,623 --> 01:29:07,257
What's wrong
with your eye?

1457
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:08,391
Oh, my eye.

1458
01:29:08,393 --> 01:29:10,492
Remember the, uh,
Battle of Harokin...

1459
01:29:10,494 --> 01:29:11,760
when I got hit
in the face

1460
01:29:11,762 --> 01:29:13,764
with the broadsword?

1461
01:29:16,969 --> 01:29:19,204
You're not the Thor
I know at all, are you?

1462
01:29:20,005 --> 01:29:22,004
Yes, I am.

1463
01:29:22,006 --> 01:29:24,974
The future hasn't been kind
to you, has it?

1464
01:29:24,976 --> 01:29:27,476
I didn't say
I was from the future.

1465
01:29:27,478 --> 01:29:30,946
I was raised by witches, boy.

1466
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:33,651
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

1467
01:29:35,519 --> 01:29:38,053
Yeah,
I'm totally from the future.

1468
01:29:38,055 --> 01:29:39,688
Yes, you are, honey.

1469
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:41,424
I really need
to talk to you.

1470
01:29:41,426 --> 01:29:42,626
We can talk.

1471
01:30:06,549 --> 01:30:09,218
His head was over there...

1472
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:12,620
and his body over there...

1473
01:30:12,622 --> 01:30:16,191
I mean, what was
the point? I was too late.

1474
01:30:16,193 --> 01:30:17,894
I was just standing there.

1475
01:30:18,661 --> 01:30:20,595
Some idiot with an axe.

1476
01:30:20,597 --> 01:30:22,565
Now,
you're no idiot.

1477
01:30:23,467 --> 01:30:25,099
You're here, aren't you?

1478
01:30:25,101 --> 01:30:28,136
Seeking counsel from
the wisest person in Asgard.

1479
01:30:28,138 --> 01:30:29,304
I am. Yes.

1480
01:30:29,306 --> 01:30:30,905
Idiot, no.

1481
01:30:30,907 --> 01:30:32,441
A failure?

1482
01:30:32,443 --> 01:30:33,674
Absolutely.

1483
01:30:33,676 --> 01:30:35,643
That's a little bit harsh.

1484
01:30:35,645 --> 01:30:37,247
Do you know
what that makes you?

1485
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:40,548
Just like everyone else.

1486
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:42,884
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1487
01:30:42,886 --> 01:30:44,052
Mm.

1488
01:30:44,054 --> 01:30:47,755
Everyone fails at who
they're supposed to be, Thor.

1489
01:30:47,757 --> 01:30:50,925
The measure of a person,
of a hero...

1490
01:30:50,927 --> 01:30:54,630
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1491
01:30:59,635 --> 01:31:01,204
I've really
missed you, Mom.

1492
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:08,911
Thor! I got it!

1493
01:31:09,611 --> 01:31:11,247
Get that rabbit!

1494
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:16,049
Mom, I have to
tell you something.

1495
01:31:16,051 --> 01:31:17,818
No, son, you don't.

1496
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:20,555
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

1497
01:31:20,557 --> 01:31:22,356
This is about your future.

1498
01:31:22,358 --> 01:31:23,892
Uh, it's none of
my business.

1499
01:31:27,896 --> 01:31:29,229
Hi.

1500
01:31:29,231 --> 01:31:31,164
You must be Mom.

1501
01:31:31,166 --> 01:31:32,866
I got the thing.
Come on. We gotta move.

1502
01:31:32,868 --> 01:31:34,569
Oh, I wish
we had more time.

1503
01:31:34,571 --> 01:31:36,571
No, this was a gift.

1504
01:31:36,573 --> 01:31:40,474
Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.

1505
01:31:40,476 --> 01:31:41,608
I love you, Mom.

1506
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:42,811
I love you.

1507
01:31:47,182 --> 01:31:49,118
And eat a salad.

1508
01:31:50,119 --> 01:31:51,351
Come on, we gotta go.

1509
01:31:51,353 --> 01:31:53,153
- Goodbye.
- Three...

1510
01:31:53,155 --> 01:31:54,223
- Two...
- No, wait!

1511
01:31:57,426 --> 01:31:58,724
What am I looking at?

1512
01:31:58,726 --> 01:32:00,295
Oh, sometimes
it takes a second.

1513
01:32:09,704 --> 01:32:11,906
I'm still worthy.

1514
01:32:13,242 --> 01:32:14,942
Oh, boy.

1515
01:32:15,877 --> 01:32:18,012
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye.

1516
01:32:57,218 --> 01:32:58,920
So, he's an idiot?

1517
01:33:00,188 --> 01:33:01,721
Yeah.

1518
01:33:10,131 --> 01:33:11,430
What's that?

1519
01:33:11,432 --> 01:33:13,334
The tool of a thief.

1520
01:33:21,007 --> 01:33:22,941
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1521
01:33:22,943 --> 01:33:24,776
This is the part
where spikes come out...

1522
01:33:24,778 --> 01:33:26,445
with skeletons on the end
of them and everything.

1523
01:33:26,447 --> 01:33:27,745
What are you
talking about?

1524
01:33:27,747 --> 01:33:28,846
When you break into
a place called

1525
01:33:28,848 --> 01:33:30,148
"The Temple
of the Power Stone"...

1526
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:31,716
there's gonna be
a bunch of booby traps.

1527
01:33:31,718 --> 01:33:34,120
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1528
01:34:07,354 --> 01:34:08,954
I wasn't always like this.

1529
01:34:09,689 --> 01:34:10,889
Me either.

1530
01:34:12,525 --> 01:34:14,093
But we work
with what we got, right?

1531
01:34:15,662 --> 01:34:16,929
Hmm.

1532
01:34:17,697 --> 01:34:19,432
Let's sync up.

1533
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:23,902
Three, two, one.

1534
01:34:36,582 --> 01:34:38,215
<i>You murdered trillions!</i>

1535
01:34:38,217 --> 01:34:39,716
<i>You should be grateful.</i>

1536
01:34:41,253 --> 01:34:43,253
<i>Where are the stones?</i>

1537
01:34:43,255 --> 01:34:44,256
<i>Gone.</i>

1538
01:34:44,857 --> 01:34:46,623
<i>Reduced to atoms.</i>

1539
01:34:46,625 --> 01:34:48,392
<i>You used them
two days ago!</i>

1540
01:34:48,394 --> 01:34:51,728
<i>I used the stones
to destroy the stones.</i>

1541
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:53,730
<i>It nearly killed me.</i>

1542
01:34:53,732 --> 01:34:55,798
<i>But the work is done.</i>

1543
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,869
<i>It always will be.</i>

1544
01:34:58,903 --> 01:35:02,474
<i>I am inevitable.</i>

1545
01:35:03,676 --> 01:35:05,841
What did you do
to them?

1546
01:35:05,843 --> 01:35:07,246
Nothing.

1547
01:35:08,146 --> 01:35:09,381
Yet.

1548
01:35:11,015 --> 01:35:13,015
They're not trying
to stop something

1549
01:35:13,017 --> 01:35:15,051
I'm going to do
in our time.

1550
01:35:15,053 --> 01:35:17,119
They're trying
to undo something

1551
01:35:17,121 --> 01:35:18,888
I've already done
in theirs.

1552
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:20,825
The stones.

1553
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,494
I found them all.

1554
01:35:25,330 --> 01:35:27,229
I won.

1555
01:35:27,231 --> 01:35:30,401
Tipped the cosmic scales
to balance.

1556
01:35:34,405 --> 01:35:36,472
This is your future.

1557
01:35:36,474 --> 01:35:38,509
It's my destiny.

1558
01:35:39,677 --> 01:35:41,844
<i>My father is many things.</i>

1559
01:35:41,846 --> 01:35:43,915
<i>A liar is not one of them.</i>

1560
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:46,451
<i>Ah.</i>

1561
01:35:47,485 --> 01:35:49,552
<i>Thank you, daughter.</i>

1562
01:35:49,554 --> 01:35:51,953
<i>Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.</i>

1563
01:35:56,093 --> 01:35:59,197
And that is
destiny fulfilled.

1564
01:35:59,530 --> 01:36:00,962
Sire...

1565
01:36:00,964 --> 01:36:02,565
your daughter...

1566
01:36:04,635 --> 01:36:06,000
No!

1567
01:36:06,002 --> 01:36:07,168
...is a traitor.

1568
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:09,871
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

1569
01:36:09,873 --> 01:36:11,339
I would never betray you.

1570
01:36:11,341 --> 01:36:13,210
Never. Never.

1571
01:36:18,816 --> 01:36:20,915
I know.

1572
01:36:20,917 --> 01:36:24,321
And you'll have the chance
to prove it.

1573
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:31,628
No!

1574
01:36:32,396 --> 01:36:33,563
He knows!

1575
01:36:38,034 --> 01:36:40,270
Barton! Barton, come in.

1576
01:36:40,771 --> 01:36:42,704
Romanoff!

1577
01:36:42,706 --> 01:36:44,372
Come in, we have a problem.

1578
01:36:44,374 --> 01:36:45,607
Come on!

1579
01:36:45,609 --> 01:36:47,275
Come in, we have a...

1580
01:36:47,277 --> 01:36:48,545
Thanos knows.

1581
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:50,480
Thanos...

1582
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:05,327
Cap.

1583
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:09,129
Sorry, buddy,
we got a problem.

1584
01:37:09,131 --> 01:37:11,833
Yeah, we do.

1585
01:37:11,835 --> 01:37:13,033
Well,
what are we gonna do now?

1586
01:37:13,035 --> 01:37:14,101
You know what?
Give me a break, Steve.

1587
01:37:14,103 --> 01:37:15,469
I just got hit in the head
with the Hulk.

1588
01:37:15,471 --> 01:37:17,438
You said
that we had one shot.

1589
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:18,640
This was our shot.

1590
01:37:18,642 --> 01:37:20,775
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

1591
01:37:20,777 --> 01:37:22,409
- It was six stones or nothing.
- You're repeating yourself,

1592
01:37:22,411 --> 01:37:23,745
you know that?
You're repeating yourself.

1593
01:37:23,747 --> 01:37:25,546
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1594
01:37:25,548 --> 01:37:26,413
Dude. Come on!

1595
01:37:26,415 --> 01:37:27,548
No. You never wanted
a time heist.

1596
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:29,049
You weren't on board
with the time heist.

1597
01:37:29,051 --> 01:37:30,117
- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.

1598
01:37:30,119 --> 01:37:31,351
- Is that what I did?
- Yeah.

1599
01:37:31,353 --> 01:37:33,320
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1600
01:37:33,322 --> 01:37:34,822
No, no, no, there's
no other options.

1601
01:37:34,824 --> 01:37:36,223
There's no do-overs.

1602
01:37:36,225 --> 01:37:38,459
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

1603
01:37:38,461 --> 01:37:39,359
Each.

1604
01:37:39,361 --> 01:37:41,929
That's it. All right?
We use that...

1605
01:37:41,931 --> 01:37:43,230
bye-bye,
you're not going home.

1606
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:45,299
Yeah, well,
if we don't try...

1607
01:37:45,301 --> 01:37:46,767
then no one else
is going home, either.

1608
01:37:46,769 --> 01:37:47,969
I got it.

1609
01:37:48,938 --> 01:37:51,205
There's another way
to retake the Tesseract

1610
01:37:51,207 --> 01:37:53,841
and acquire new particles.

1611
01:37:53,843 --> 01:37:55,509
Little stroll down
memory lane.

1612
01:37:55,511 --> 01:37:57,580
Military installation,
Garden State.

1613
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:02,816
When were they both there?

1614
01:38:02,818 --> 01:38:06,052
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

1615
01:38:06,054 --> 01:38:07,119
- How vague?
- What are you talking about?

1616
01:38:07,121 --> 01:38:08,254
Where are we going?

1617
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:09,288
I know for a fact
they were there.

1618
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:10,557
Who's they?
What are we doing?

1619
01:38:10,559 --> 01:38:11,627
And I know how I know.

1620
01:38:13,561 --> 01:38:15,662
Guys, what is it?

1621
01:38:15,664 --> 01:38:17,330
Looks like
we're improvising.

1622
01:38:17,332 --> 01:38:18,732
- Great.
- What are we improvising?

1623
01:38:18,734 --> 01:38:20,666
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

1624
01:38:20,668 --> 01:38:21,869
Suit up.

1625
01:38:21,871 --> 01:38:23,469
- What's in New Jersey?
- 0-4.

1626
01:38:23,471 --> 01:38:24,570
0-4.

1627
01:38:24,572 --> 01:38:25,705
- Uh, 0-7.
- 0-7.

1628
01:38:25,707 --> 01:38:27,975
- Excuse me.
- 1-9-7-0.

1629
01:38:27,977 --> 01:38:29,041
Are you sure?

1630
01:38:29,043 --> 01:38:30,610
Cap? Captain?

1631
01:38:30,612 --> 01:38:32,612
Steve? Sorry.

1632
01:38:32,614 --> 01:38:34,247
America. Rogers.

1633
01:38:34,249 --> 01:38:35,648
Look, if you do this...

1634
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:38,486
and it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1635
01:38:39,354 --> 01:38:41,389
Thanks for the pep talk,
pissant.

1636
01:38:42,423 --> 01:38:43,591
You trust me?

1637
01:38:44,492 --> 01:38:45,627
I do.

1638
01:38:46,661 --> 01:38:48,128
Your call.

1639
01:38:48,830 --> 01:38:50,598
Here we go.

1640
01:39:06,446 --> 01:39:10,350
Hey, man!
Make love, not war.

1641
01:39:16,089 --> 01:39:18,958
Clearly you weren't
actually born here, right?

1642
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,493
The idea of me was.

1643
01:39:21,495 --> 01:39:23,295
Right. Well,
imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1644
01:39:23,297 --> 01:39:26,667
running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

1645
01:39:27,936 --> 01:39:29,734
where do you hide it?

1646
01:39:29,736 --> 01:39:31,471
In plain sight.

1647
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,032
Good luck
on your mission, Captain.

1648
01:40:01,034 --> 01:40:03,670
Good luck
on your project, Doctor.

1649
01:40:07,007 --> 01:40:08,274
You new here?

1650
01:40:10,711 --> 01:40:12,178
Not exactly.

1651
01:40:18,751 --> 01:40:20,586
Come on, you bastard.

1652
01:40:27,426 --> 01:40:28,828
Gotcha.

1653
01:40:33,733 --> 01:40:34,734
Whew.

1654
01:40:46,244 --> 01:40:48,179
Back in the game.

1655
01:40:50,716 --> 01:40:51,884
Arnim, you in there?

1656
01:40:52,852 --> 01:40:53,886
Arnim?

1657
01:40:59,125 --> 01:41:01,125
Hey!

1658
01:41:01,127 --> 01:41:02,895
The door is this way, pal.

1659
01:41:03,763 --> 01:41:04,762
Oh, yeah.

1660
01:41:04,764 --> 01:41:06,764
Looking for Doctor Zola,
have you seen him?

1661
01:41:06,766 --> 01:41:10,502
Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

1662
01:41:11,904 --> 01:41:13,371
Pardon me.

1663
01:41:13,973 --> 01:41:15,674
Do I know you?

1664
01:41:16,876 --> 01:41:17,876
No, sir. Uh...

1665
01:41:19,244 --> 01:41:21,279
I'm a visitor from MIT.

1666
01:41:21,746 --> 01:41:22,847
Oh. MIT.

1667
01:41:23,214 --> 01:41:24,516
Got a name?

1668
01:41:24,883 --> 01:41:26,116
Howard.

1669
01:41:26,118 --> 01:41:28,720
- That'll be easy to remember.
- Howard...

1670
01:41:29,721 --> 01:41:31,187
Potts.

1671
01:41:31,189 --> 01:41:33,690
Well,
I'm Howard Stark.

1672
01:41:33,692 --> 01:41:34,557
Hi.

1673
01:41:34,559 --> 01:41:36,125
Shake that,
don't pull it.

1674
01:41:36,127 --> 01:41:37,328
Yeah.

1675
01:41:38,463 --> 01:41:40,963
You look a little green around the
gills, there, Potts.

1676
01:41:40,965 --> 01:41:43,231
I'm fine.
Just long hours.

1677
01:41:43,233 --> 01:41:45,202
You wanna get some air?

1678
01:41:47,439 --> 01:41:49,404
- Hello, Potts.
- Yeah.

1679
01:41:49,406 --> 01:41:50,940
- That'd be swell.
- That way.

1680
01:41:50,942 --> 01:41:52,041
Okay.

1681
01:41:52,043 --> 01:41:53,778
Need your briefcase?

1682
01:41:57,849 --> 01:42:00,719
You're not one of those
beatniks, are you, Potts?

1683
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:08,157
- Hello?
- <i>Doctor Pym?</i>

1684
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:10,692
That would be the
number that you called, yes.

1685
01:42:10,694 --> 01:42:13,196
<i>This is Captain Stevens
from shipping.</i>

1686
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:14,362
<i>We have a package for you.</i>

1687
01:42:14,364 --> 01:42:16,065
Oh, bring it up.

1688
01:42:16,067 --> 01:42:18,235
<i>That's the thing, sir,
we can't.</i>

1689
01:42:19,137 --> 01:42:21,970
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

1690
01:42:21,972 --> 01:42:23,405
<i>Well, it's just...</i>

1691
01:42:23,407 --> 01:42:25,108
<i>Sir, the box is glowing...</i>

1692
01:42:25,110 --> 01:42:26,441
<i>and to be honest,</i>

1693
01:42:26,443 --> 01:42:28,076
<i>some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.</i>

1694
01:42:28,078 --> 01:42:29,778
They didn't open it,
did they?

1695
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:32,316
<i>Uh, yeah, they did.
You better get down here.</i>

1696
01:42:32,983 --> 01:42:34,918
Excuse me!
Out of the way!

1697
01:43:01,879 --> 01:43:05,681
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

1698
01:43:06,282 --> 01:43:07,983
Uh, my wife's expecting.

1699
01:43:07,985 --> 01:43:10,853
And too much time
at the office.

1700
01:43:12,722 --> 01:43:13,954
Congratulations.

1701
01:43:13,956 --> 01:43:17,358
- Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
- Yeah, sure.

1702
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,595
- How far along is she?
- Uh, I don't know.

1703
01:43:21,231 --> 01:43:22,396
She's at the point where

1704
01:43:22,398 --> 01:43:23,964
she can't stand
the sound of my chewing.

1705
01:43:23,966 --> 01:43:27,737
I guess I'll be eating
dinner in the pantry again.

1706
01:43:28,471 --> 01:43:29,804
I have a little girl.

1707
01:43:29,806 --> 01:43:31,338
A girl would be nice.

1708
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:34,074
Less of a chance she'd
turn out exactly like me.

1709
01:43:34,076 --> 01:43:35,576
What'd be so awful
about that?

1710
01:43:35,578 --> 01:43:37,645
Let's just say
that the greater good

1711
01:43:37,647 --> 01:43:41,083
has rarely outweighed
my own self-interest.

1712
01:43:44,921 --> 01:43:46,587
And you've never seen
these two men before?

1713
01:43:46,589 --> 01:43:48,289
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

1714
01:43:48,291 --> 01:43:49,355
Can you describe them?

1715
01:43:49,357 --> 01:43:50,658
One of them
had a hippie beard.

1716
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:52,893
Hippie.
Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1717
01:43:52,895 --> 01:43:54,261
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1718
01:43:54,263 --> 01:43:55,361
Yeah, this is Chesler.

1719
01:43:55,363 --> 01:43:56,529
I need every available MP
to sublevel six.

1720
01:43:56,531 --> 01:43:58,633
We have
a potential breach.

1721
01:44:16,351 --> 01:44:17,517
I said bring them in.

1722
01:44:17,519 --> 01:44:18,618
They're trying, ma'am,
but Braddock's unit

1723
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:19,819
has been stopped
by lightning strikes.

1724
01:44:19,821 --> 01:44:20,720
Oh, for the love of...

1725
01:44:20,722 --> 01:44:22,524
I'll look at
the weather projections.

1726
01:44:46,348 --> 01:44:48,549
It's not lightning strikes
we're looking at.

1727
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:01,526
So, where you at
with names?

1728
01:45:01,528 --> 01:45:04,763
Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Elmonzo.

1729
01:45:04,765 --> 01:45:07,000
Huh. Might wanna
let that stew awhile.

1730
01:45:07,002 --> 01:45:08,569
- You got time.
- Uh-huh.

1731
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:12,272
Let me ask you
a question.

1732
01:45:12,274 --> 01:45:15,607
When your kid was born,
were you nervous?

1733
01:45:15,609 --> 01:45:17,277
Wildly.

1734
01:45:17,279 --> 01:45:19,177
- Yeah.
- Did you feel qualified?

1735
01:45:19,179 --> 01:45:20,946
Like you had any idea

1736
01:45:20,948 --> 01:45:22,981
how to successfully operate
that thing?

1737
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:26,184
I literally pieced it
together as I went along.

1738
01:45:26,186 --> 01:45:28,553
I thought about
what my dad did.

1739
01:45:28,555 --> 01:45:29,855
My old man,

1740
01:45:29,857 --> 01:45:31,723
he never met a problem he
couldn't solve with a belt.

1741
01:45:31,725 --> 01:45:34,092
I thought my dad
was tough on me.

1742
01:45:34,094 --> 01:45:35,426
And now,
looking back on it,

1743
01:45:35,428 --> 01:45:36,795
I just remember
the good stuff.

1744
01:45:36,797 --> 01:45:38,597
You know? He did drop
the odd pearl.

1745
01:45:38,599 --> 01:45:40,999
Yeah? Like what?

1746
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:43,804
"No amount of money ever
bought a second of time."

1747
01:45:45,072 --> 01:45:46,437
Smart guy.

1748
01:45:46,439 --> 01:45:48,008
He did his best.

1749
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:50,775
I'll tell you,
that kid's not even here yet

1750
01:45:50,777 --> 01:45:53,479
and there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

1751
01:46:02,089 --> 01:46:03,589
Good to meet you, Potts.

1752
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:04,991
Yeah.

1753
01:46:05,326 --> 01:46:06,924
Howard...

1754
01:46:06,926 --> 01:46:08,795
everything's gonna be
all right.

1755
01:46:11,798 --> 01:46:12,999
Thank you...

1756
01:46:13,967 --> 01:46:15,566
for everything...

1757
01:46:15,568 --> 01:46:18,004
you've done
for this country.

1758
01:46:20,907 --> 01:46:22,008
Jarvis.

1759
01:46:25,578 --> 01:46:27,213
Have we ever met
that guy?

1760
01:46:29,215 --> 01:46:30,817
You meet
a lot of people, sir.

1761
01:46:33,319 --> 01:46:35,021
Seems very familiar.

1762
01:46:35,955 --> 01:46:37,522
Weird beard.

1763
01:46:45,298 --> 01:46:46,799
You're weak.

1764
01:46:47,233 --> 01:46:48,500
I'm you.

1765
01:47:05,817 --> 01:47:08,319
You could stop this.

1766
01:47:08,321 --> 01:47:10,720
You know you want to.

1767
01:47:10,722 --> 01:47:13,058
Did you see what happens
in the future?

1768
01:47:14,293 --> 01:47:16,795
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1769
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:20,232
You wanna know
how he does that?

1770
01:47:21,533 --> 01:47:25,871
You wanna know
what he does to you?

1771
01:47:26,271 --> 01:47:27,670
That's enough.

1772
01:47:40,018 --> 01:47:41,685
You disgust me.

1773
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:47,825
But that doesn't mean
you're useless.

1774
01:48:09,381 --> 01:48:11,148
How do I look?

1775
01:48:17,822 --> 01:48:18,823
Wow.

1776
01:48:19,623 --> 01:48:22,858
Under different
circumstances...

1777
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:25,062
this would be
totally awesome.

1778
01:48:36,807 --> 01:48:38,373
I bet the raccoon

1779
01:48:38,375 --> 01:48:39,975
didn't have to climb
a mountain.

1780
01:48:39,977 --> 01:48:41,977
Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

1781
01:48:41,979 --> 01:48:43,811
Oh, whatever.
He eats garbage.

1782
01:48:43,813 --> 01:48:45,282
Welcome.

1783
01:48:48,419 --> 01:48:49,817
Natasha.

1784
01:48:49,819 --> 01:48:51,021
Daughter of Ivan.

1785
01:48:52,289 --> 01:48:53,522
Clint.

1786
01:48:53,524 --> 01:48:55,959
Son of Edith.

1787
01:49:01,265 --> 01:49:03,332
Who are you?

1788
01:49:03,334 --> 01:49:06,033
Consider me a guide...

1789
01:49:06,035 --> 01:49:07,702
to you...

1790
01:49:07,704 --> 01:49:09,704
and to all who seek
the Soul Stone.

1791
01:49:09,706 --> 01:49:11,005
Oh, good.

1792
01:49:11,007 --> 01:49:13,176
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1793
01:49:16,913 --> 01:49:19,315
If only it were that easy.

1794
01:49:31,194 --> 01:49:35,165
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1795
01:49:36,366 --> 01:49:38,902
As does what you fear.

1796
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:46,240
The stone's down there.

1797
01:49:46,242 --> 01:49:48,409
For one of you.

1798
01:49:48,411 --> 01:49:50,180
For the other...

1799
01:49:52,714 --> 01:49:54,781
In order to take
the stone...

1800
01:49:54,783 --> 01:49:57,986
you must lose
that which you love.

1801
01:49:59,289 --> 01:50:02,425
An everlasting exchange.

1802
01:50:03,426 --> 01:50:07,696
A soul for a soul.

1803
01:50:09,965 --> 01:50:12,834
How's it going?

1804
01:50:15,003 --> 01:50:16,604
Jesus.

1805
01:50:16,606 --> 01:50:18,373
Maybe he's making
this shit up.

1806
01:50:19,274 --> 01:50:20,742
No.

1807
01:50:21,410 --> 01:50:22,976
I don't think so.

1808
01:50:22,978 --> 01:50:25,314
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1809
01:50:26,714 --> 01:50:27,950
I didn't.

1810
01:50:29,151 --> 01:50:31,853
Thanos left here
with the stone...

1811
01:50:32,387 --> 01:50:33,954
without his daughter.

1812
01:50:33,956 --> 01:50:36,225
That's not a coincidence.

1813
01:50:37,292 --> 01:50:38,994
Yeah.

1814
01:50:40,562 --> 01:50:42,464
Whatever it takes.

1815
01:50:46,867 --> 01:50:48,470
Whatever it takes.

1816
01:50:52,773 --> 01:50:54,873
If we don't get that stone...

1817
01:50:54,875 --> 01:50:56,811
billions of people stay dead.

1818
01:50:57,512 --> 01:50:58,846
Yeah.

1819
01:51:00,349 --> 01:51:02,850
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1820
01:51:03,452 --> 01:51:04,785
I guess we do.

1821
01:51:12,927 --> 01:51:14,728
I'm starting to think

1822
01:51:14,730 --> 01:51:18,097
we mean different
people here, Natasha.

1823
01:51:18,099 --> 01:51:20,299
For the last five years,
I've been trying to do one thing.

1824
01:51:20,301 --> 01:51:21,433
Get to right here.

1825
01:51:21,435 --> 01:51:23,769
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1826
01:51:23,771 --> 01:51:26,071
No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

1827
01:51:26,073 --> 01:51:28,741
What, you think
I wanna do it?

1828
01:51:28,743 --> 01:51:30,676
I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.

1829
01:51:30,678 --> 01:51:33,878
Yeah, well, I don't
want you to. How's that?

1830
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:36,250
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1831
01:51:37,784 --> 01:51:39,819
You know what I've become.

1832
01:51:41,722 --> 01:51:42,887
Oh, I don't judge people

1833
01:51:42,889 --> 01:51:44,392
on their worst mistakes.

1834
01:51:48,529 --> 01:51:49,929
Maybe you should.

1835
01:51:50,631 --> 01:51:52,265
You didn't.

1836
01:51:58,204 --> 01:52:00,574
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

1837
01:52:11,652 --> 01:52:13,019
Okay.

1838
01:52:14,621 --> 01:52:16,222
You win.

1839
01:52:22,595 --> 01:52:23,930
Tell my family I love 'em.

1840
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:28,865
You tell 'em yourself.

1841
01:53:01,568 --> 01:53:02,569
Damn you.

1842
01:53:10,175 --> 01:53:11,176
Wait.

1843
01:53:19,218 --> 01:53:21,086
Let me go.

1844
01:53:22,287 --> 01:53:23,288
No.

1845
01:53:24,889 --> 01:53:26,091
No. Please, no.

1846
01:53:29,395 --> 01:53:31,263
It's okay.

1847
01:53:33,298 --> 01:53:34,299
Please.

1848
01:53:36,368 --> 01:53:37,369
No!

1849
01:55:18,768 --> 01:55:19,769
Did we get 'em all?

1850
01:55:21,104 --> 01:55:23,139
Are you telling me
this actually worked?

1851
01:55:27,811 --> 01:55:29,179
Clint, where's Nat?

1852
01:55:58,173 --> 01:55:59,375
Do we know
if she had family?

1853
01:56:00,509 --> 01:56:01,776
Yeah.

1854
01:56:01,778 --> 01:56:02,779
Us.

1855
01:56:04,313 --> 01:56:05,347
What?

1856
01:56:06,248 --> 01:56:07,314
Huh?

1857
01:56:07,316 --> 01:56:08,448
- What are you doing?
- Just asked him a question.

1858
01:56:08,450 --> 01:56:09,918
Yeah, no, you're acting
like she's dead.

1859
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,084
Why are we acting
like she's dead?

1860
01:56:11,086 --> 01:56:12,419
We have the stones, right?

1861
01:56:12,421 --> 01:56:13,654
As long as we have
the stones...

1862
01:56:13,656 --> 01:56:15,489
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

1863
01:56:15,491 --> 01:56:17,824
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers.
Get it together.

1864
01:56:17,826 --> 01:56:19,194
Can't get her back.

1865
01:56:21,997 --> 01:56:23,530
What's he...?
What?

1866
01:56:23,532 --> 01:56:24,700
It can't be undone.

1867
01:56:25,367 --> 01:56:27,135
It can't.

1868
01:56:29,338 --> 01:56:30,904
Look, I'm sorry,
no offense,

1869
01:56:30,906 --> 01:56:32,573
but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

1870
01:56:32,575 --> 01:56:34,140
And we're talking
about space magic.

1871
01:56:34,142 --> 01:56:36,275
And "can't" seems very definitive.
Don't you think?

1872
01:56:36,277 --> 01:56:37,844
Yeah, look, I know
that I'm way outside

1873
01:56:37,846 --> 01:56:39,312
my pay grade here.

1874
01:56:39,314 --> 01:56:40,981
But she still
isn't here, is she?

1875
01:56:40,983 --> 01:56:42,114
No, that's my point.

1876
01:56:42,116 --> 01:56:45,217
It can't be undone.

1877
01:56:45,219 --> 01:56:46,620
Or that's at least

1878
01:56:46,622 --> 01:56:48,622
what the red,
floating guy had to say.

1879
01:56:48,624 --> 01:56:50,323
Maybe you wanna go
talk to him, okay?

1880
01:56:50,325 --> 01:56:53,561
Go grab your hammer and you
go fly and you talk to him.

1881
01:57:02,004 --> 01:57:04,238
It was supposed to be me.

1882
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:08,808
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

1883
01:57:08,810 --> 01:57:10,378
She bet her life on it.

1884
01:57:15,116 --> 01:57:17,585
She's not coming back.

1885
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:20,788
We have to make it
worth it.

1886
01:57:21,456 --> 01:57:22,824
We have to.

1887
01:57:24,157 --> 01:57:25,893
We will.

1888
01:57:50,651 --> 01:57:51,753
Boom!

1889
01:57:57,290 --> 01:57:59,491
All right,
the glove's ready.

1890
01:57:59,493 --> 01:58:02,293
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freakin' fingers?

1891
01:58:02,295 --> 01:58:04,663
- I'll do it.
- Excuse me?

1892
01:58:04,665 --> 01:58:05,563
It's okay.

1893
01:58:05,565 --> 01:58:06,831
Stop, stop.
Slow down.

1894
01:58:06,833 --> 01:58:08,366
Thor. Just wait.

1895
01:58:08,368 --> 01:58:10,535
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

1896
01:58:10,537 --> 01:58:12,270
I'm sorry. What, we're all
just sitting around

1897
01:58:12,272 --> 01:58:13,605
waiting for
the right opportunity?

1898
01:58:13,607 --> 01:58:15,040
We should at least
discuss it.

1899
01:58:15,042 --> 01:58:17,075
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

1900
01:58:17,077 --> 01:58:18,912
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

1901
01:58:19,946 --> 01:58:21,413
I'm the strongest Avenger,
okay?

1902
01:58:21,415 --> 01:58:23,014
So, this responsibility
falls upon me.

1903
01:58:23,016 --> 01:58:24,314
- Normally, you're right.
- It's my duty.

1904
01:58:24,316 --> 01:58:26,283
- It's not about that.
- It's not that.

1905
01:58:26,285 --> 01:58:28,320
- Hey, buddy...
- Stop it! Just let me.

1906
01:58:31,124 --> 01:58:32,657
Just let me do it.

1907
01:58:32,659 --> 01:58:35,392
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

1908
01:58:35,394 --> 01:58:36,594
Look, it's not
just the fact...

1909
01:58:36,596 --> 01:58:37,896
that that glove is channeling
enough energy

1910
01:58:37,898 --> 01:58:38,830
to light up a continent.

1911
01:58:38,832 --> 01:58:40,899
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

1912
01:58:40,901 --> 01:58:44,268
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

1913
01:58:44,270 --> 01:58:45,504
Cheez Whiz?

1914
01:58:47,941 --> 01:58:49,074
Lightning.

1915
01:58:49,076 --> 01:58:50,307
Yeah.
Lightning.

1916
01:58:50,309 --> 01:58:51,943
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1917
01:58:51,945 --> 01:58:53,813
It's gotta be me.

1918
01:58:55,082 --> 01:58:57,347
You saw what those
stones did to Thanos.

1919
01:58:57,349 --> 01:58:58,985
They almost killed him.

1920
01:59:00,319 --> 01:59:02,986
None of you could survive.

1921
01:59:02,988 --> 01:59:04,822
How do we know
you will?

1922
01:59:04,824 --> 01:59:06,091
We don't.

1923
01:59:06,093 --> 01:59:08,728
But the radiation's
mostly gamma.

1924
01:59:12,131 --> 01:59:13,799
It's like...

1925
01:59:15,701 --> 01:59:17,636
I was made for this.

1926
01:59:36,387 --> 01:59:37,990
Good to go, yeah?

1927
01:59:40,092 --> 01:59:41,225
Let's do it.

1928
01:59:41,227 --> 01:59:42,592
Okay, remember,

1929
01:59:42,594 --> 01:59:44,393
everyone Thanos snapped away
five years ago...

1930
01:59:44,395 --> 01:59:46,897
you're just bringing them
back to now, today.

1931
01:59:46,899 --> 01:59:48,633
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1932
01:59:49,969 --> 01:59:51,302
Got it.

1933
02:00:07,418 --> 02:00:08,718
<i>Friday, do me a favor</i>

1934
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:10,386
<i>and activate Barn Door
Protocol, will ya?</i>

1935
02:00:10,388 --> 02:00:11,823
<i>Yes, boss.</i>

1936
02:00:20,297 --> 02:00:22,366
Everybody comes home.

1937
02:00:45,489 --> 02:00:47,156
Take it off! Take it off!

1938
02:00:47,158 --> 02:00:48,590
No, wait.
Bruce, are you okay?

1939
02:00:48,592 --> 02:00:50,761
<i>Talk to me, Banner.</i>

1940
02:00:53,897 --> 02:00:54,898
I'm okay.

1941
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:56,733
I'm okay.

1942
02:01:28,098 --> 02:01:29,398
Bruce!

1943
02:01:31,001 --> 02:01:32,668
Don't move him.

1944
02:01:39,408 --> 02:01:41,577
- Did it work?
- We're not sure. It's okay.

1945
02:02:27,990 --> 02:02:29,023
Honey.

1946
02:02:29,025 --> 02:02:30,124
<i>Clint?</i>

1947
02:02:30,126 --> 02:02:31,526
Honey.

1948
02:02:32,194 --> 02:02:33,662
Guys...

1949
02:02:36,032 --> 02:02:37,532
I think it worked.

1950
02:03:19,874 --> 02:03:21,808
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

1951
02:03:23,144 --> 02:03:24,980
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

1952
02:03:31,485 --> 02:03:33,520
Rhodey, Rocket,
get out of here.

1953
02:03:34,456 --> 02:03:36,091
Let me up! Let me up!

1954
02:03:36,890 --> 02:03:37,691
Come on!

1955
02:03:47,801 --> 02:03:48,669
Rhodey!

1956
02:03:50,305 --> 02:03:51,605
Huh?

1957
02:03:56,910 --> 02:03:58,744
<i>Mayday, Mayday!
Does anybody copy?</i>

1958
02:03:58,746 --> 02:04:00,278
<i>We're on the lower level.
It's flooding!</i>

1959
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:01,980
What? What?

1960
02:04:01,982 --> 02:04:04,450
<i>We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!</i>

1961
02:04:04,452 --> 02:04:06,718
Wait! I'm here!

1962
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:08,522
I'm here. Can you hear me?

1963
02:04:28,042 --> 02:04:29,209
Cap?

1964
02:04:53,199 --> 02:04:54,300
Okay.

1965
02:05:13,519 --> 02:05:14,952
Daughter.

1966
02:05:14,954 --> 02:05:16,089
Yes, Father.

1967
02:05:17,790 --> 02:05:19,758
So, this is the future.

1968
02:05:20,293 --> 02:05:21,160
Well done.

1969
02:05:22,095 --> 02:05:23,626
Thank you, Father.

1970
02:05:23,628 --> 02:05:25,131
They suspected nothing.

1971
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:28,968
The arrogant never do.

1972
02:05:31,937 --> 02:05:33,837
Go.

1973
02:05:33,839 --> 02:05:36,474
Find the stones,
bring them to me.

1974
02:05:36,476 --> 02:05:38,244
What will you do?

1975
02:05:39,512 --> 02:05:41,247
Wait.

1976
02:06:06,438 --> 02:06:08,173
Tell me something.

1977
02:06:09,274 --> 02:06:11,741
In the future...

1978
02:06:11,743 --> 02:06:13,845
what happens
to you and me?

1979
02:06:16,081 --> 02:06:17,781
I try to kill you.

1980
02:06:19,351 --> 02:06:20,952
Several times.

1981
02:06:21,819 --> 02:06:24,120
But eventually...

1982
02:06:24,122 --> 02:06:26,091
we become friends.

1983
02:06:27,492 --> 02:06:29,261
We become sisters.

1984
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,169
Come on.

1985
02:06:40,204 --> 02:06:42,039
We can stop him.

1986
02:06:49,914 --> 02:06:51,447
Come on, buddy,
wake up!

1987
02:06:51,449 --> 02:06:54,116
That's my man.

1988
02:06:54,118 --> 02:06:56,353
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

1989
02:06:59,790 --> 02:07:01,056
What happened?

1990
02:07:01,058 --> 02:07:03,492
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

1991
02:07:03,494 --> 02:07:04,395
You'll see.

1992
02:07:26,483 --> 02:07:27,984
What's he been doing?

1993
02:07:29,719 --> 02:07:31,255
Absolutely nothing.

1994
02:07:32,855 --> 02:07:35,056
Where are the stones?

1995
02:07:35,058 --> 02:07:37,126
Somewhere under all this.

1996
02:07:38,429 --> 02:07:40,728
All I know is
he doesn't have 'em.

1997
02:07:40,730 --> 02:07:42,664
So, we keep it that way.

1998
02:07:42,666 --> 02:07:44,298
You know
it's a trap, right?

1999
02:07:44,300 --> 02:07:45,701
Yeah.

2000
02:07:45,703 --> 02:07:47,170
I don't much care.

2001
02:07:47,971 --> 02:07:49,737
Good.

2002
02:07:49,739 --> 02:07:52,406
Just as long
as we're all in agreement.

2003
02:08:01,951 --> 02:08:04,153
Let's kill him
properly this time.

2004
02:08:13,263 --> 02:08:16,399
You could not live
with your own failure.

2005
02:08:17,799 --> 02:08:19,868
Where did that bring you?

2006
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:24,540
Back to me.

2007
02:08:27,876 --> 02:08:31,545
I thought by eliminating
half of life...

2008
02:08:31,547 --> 02:08:33,980
the other half
would thrive.

2009
02:08:33,982 --> 02:08:35,451
But you've shown me...

2010
02:08:36,586 --> 02:08:38,388
that's impossible.

2011
02:08:40,122 --> 02:08:43,691
And as long as there are those
that remember what was...

2012
02:08:43,693 --> 02:08:45,158
there will always be those

2013
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:49,064
that are unable to accept
what can be.

2014
02:08:49,666 --> 02:08:51,264
They will resist.

2015
02:08:51,266 --> 02:08:53,402
Yep, we're all kinds
of stubborn.

2016
02:08:54,336 --> 02:08:56,004
I'm thankful.

2017
02:08:57,939 --> 02:08:59,873
Because now...

2018
02:08:59,875 --> 02:09:02,542
I know what I must do.

2019
02:09:02,544 --> 02:09:05,645
I will shred
this universe...

2020
02:09:05,647 --> 02:09:07,883
down to its last atom.

2021
02:09:08,517 --> 02:09:10,183
And then...

2022
02:09:10,185 --> 02:09:12,853
with the stones
you've collected for me...

2023
02:09:13,488 --> 02:09:15,722
create a new one...

2024
02:09:15,724 --> 02:09:18,023
teeming with life...

2025
02:09:18,025 --> 02:09:20,059
that knows not
what it has lost...

2026
02:09:20,061 --> 02:09:22,564
but only
what it has been given.

2027
02:09:25,634 --> 02:09:27,168
A grateful universe.

2028
02:09:27,602 --> 02:09:29,068
Born out of blood.

2029
02:09:29,070 --> 02:09:31,005
They'll never know it.

2030
02:09:31,972 --> 02:09:35,109
Because you won't be alive
to tell them.

2031
02:09:49,590 --> 02:09:50,889
See you
on the other side, man.

2032
02:09:53,094 --> 02:09:55,296
Hang on!
I'm coming!

2033
02:10:25,526 --> 02:10:26,527
Yeah!

2034
02:10:41,441 --> 02:10:43,007
Oh, hey.

2035
02:10:43,009 --> 02:10:44,978
I know you.

2036
02:10:47,715 --> 02:10:48,915
Father...

2037
02:10:49,516 --> 02:10:51,182
I have the stones.

2038
02:10:51,184 --> 02:10:52,118
What?

2039
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:54,354
Stop.

2040
02:10:59,526 --> 02:11:01,060
You're betraying us?

2041
02:11:06,866 --> 02:11:08,301
You don't have to do this.

2042
02:11:10,969 --> 02:11:13,704
I am this.

2043
02:11:13,706 --> 02:11:16,006
No, you're not.

2044
02:11:16,008 --> 02:11:18,110
You've seen what we become.

2045
02:11:23,982 --> 02:11:26,351
Nebula, listen to her.

2046
02:11:27,720 --> 02:11:28,621
You can change.

2047
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:36,962
He won't let me.

2048
02:11:38,464 --> 02:11:39,264
No!

2049
02:11:58,784 --> 02:12:00,285
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

2050
02:12:16,802 --> 02:12:18,236
<i>Boss, wake up!</i>

2051
02:13:09,487 --> 02:13:10,721
I knew it!

2052
02:14:33,036 --> 02:14:35,905
In all my years
of conquest...

2053
02:14:37,139 --> 02:14:39,141
violence...

2054
02:14:39,976 --> 02:14:42,144
slaughter...

2055
02:14:43,046 --> 02:14:45,581
it was never personal.

2056
02:14:48,051 --> 02:14:50,319
But I'll tell you now...

2057
02:14:52,122 --> 02:14:56,023
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,

2058
02:14:56,025 --> 02:14:58,527
annoying little planet...

2059
02:15:00,129 --> 02:15:02,498
I'm gonna enjoy it...

2060
02:15:03,231 --> 02:15:05,901
very, very much.

2061
02:16:09,130 --> 02:16:10,765
<i>Hey, Cap, you read me?</i>

2062
02:16:16,570 --> 02:16:19,006
<i>Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?</i>

2063
02:16:23,010 --> 02:16:24,544
<i>On your left.</i>

2064
02:17:50,095 --> 02:17:51,461
Is that everyone?

2065
02:17:51,463 --> 02:17:53,833
What? You wanted more?

2066
02:18:20,259 --> 02:18:22,427
Avengers...

2067
02:18:27,333 --> 02:18:28,464
assemble.

2068
02:19:03,768 --> 02:19:04,969
Die!

2069
02:19:25,489 --> 02:19:28,492
No, no, give me that.
You have the little one.

2070
02:19:42,039 --> 02:19:42,906
Hey!

2071
02:19:43,907 --> 02:19:44,839
Holy cow!

2072
02:19:44,841 --> 02:19:46,409
You will not believe
what's been going on.

2073
02:19:46,411 --> 02:19:47,909
Do you remember
when we were in space?

2074
02:19:47,911 --> 02:19:49,344
And I got all dusty?

2075
02:19:49,346 --> 02:19:50,478
And I must've passed out,

2076
02:19:50,480 --> 02:19:52,013
because I woke up
and you were gone.

2077
02:19:52,015 --> 02:19:53,848
But Doctor Strange was there,
right? And he was like...

2078
02:19:53,850 --> 02:19:55,583
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us."

2079
02:19:55,585 --> 02:19:57,118
And then he started doing
the yellow sparkly thing

2080
02:19:57,120 --> 02:19:58,452
- that he does all the time.
- He did? Oh, no.

2081
02:19:58,454 --> 02:20:00,924
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

2082
02:20:04,928 --> 02:20:06,529
Oh, this is nice.

2083
02:20:28,151 --> 02:20:29,152
Gamora?

2084
02:20:38,494 --> 02:20:40,229
I thought I lost you.

2085
02:20:43,766 --> 02:20:44,698
Ow.

2086
02:20:44,700 --> 02:20:47,837
Don't touch me!

2087
02:20:50,639 --> 02:20:52,639
You missed the first time.

2088
02:20:52,641 --> 02:20:54,844
Then you got 'em both
the second time.

2089
02:20:56,645 --> 02:20:58,045
This is the one?

2090
02:20:58,047 --> 02:20:59,179
Seriously?

2091
02:20:59,181 --> 02:21:01,415
Your choices were him
or a tree.

2092
02:21:12,028 --> 02:21:13,093
Cap!

2093
02:21:13,095 --> 02:21:14,964
What do you want me to do
with this damn thing?

2094
02:21:17,532 --> 02:21:19,699
Get those stones
as far away as possible!

2095
02:21:19,701 --> 02:21:20,935
No!

2096
02:21:21,870 --> 02:21:24,171
We need to get 'em back
where they came from.

2097
02:21:24,173 --> 02:21:25,038
No way to get 'em back.

2098
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:26,973
Thanos destroyed
the quantum tunnel.

2099
02:21:26,975 --> 02:21:27,842
Hold on!

2100
02:21:29,544 --> 02:21:31,711
That wasn't
our only time machine.

2101
02:21:37,652 --> 02:21:40,019
Anyone see an ugly brown van
out there?

2102
02:21:40,021 --> 02:21:43,222
Yes! But you're not gonna like
where it's parked!

2103
02:21:43,224 --> 02:21:45,727
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

2104
02:21:46,694 --> 02:21:47,960
Uh, maybe 10 minutes.

2105
02:21:47,962 --> 02:21:49,695
Get it started.
We'll get the stones to you.

2106
02:21:49,697 --> 02:21:51,332
We're on it, Cap.

2107
02:22:01,142 --> 02:22:02,175
Hey.

2108
02:22:02,177 --> 02:22:05,579
You said one out of
14 million, we win, yeah?

2109
02:22:06,314 --> 02:22:07,646
Tell me this is it.

2110
02:22:07,648 --> 02:22:09,681
If I tell you what happens...

2111
02:22:09,683 --> 02:22:11,019
it won't happen.

2112
02:22:14,489 --> 02:22:15,689
You better be right.

2113
02:22:23,831 --> 02:22:25,333
It's a mess back here.

2114
02:22:26,334 --> 02:22:27,335
It's dead.

2115
02:22:28,570 --> 02:22:30,303
- What?
- It's dead.

2116
02:22:30,305 --> 02:22:31,839
I have to hot-wire it.

2117
02:22:34,708 --> 02:22:36,076
Where's Nebula?

2118
02:22:37,177 --> 02:22:38,645
She's not responding.

2119
02:22:38,946 --> 02:22:40,214
Sire...

2120
02:22:49,823 --> 02:22:51,225
Clint!

2121
02:22:53,260 --> 02:22:54,361
Give it to me.

2122
02:23:16,583 --> 02:23:20,385
You took everything from me.

2123
02:23:20,387 --> 02:23:22,987
I don't even know
who you are.

2124
02:23:22,989 --> 02:23:24,690
You will.

2125
02:23:46,846 --> 02:23:48,014
I got it!

2126
02:23:50,449 --> 02:23:51,716
Activate Instant Kill.

2127
02:24:15,073 --> 02:24:16,342
Rain fire!

2128
02:24:16,908 --> 02:24:19,175
But, sire, our troops!

2129
02:24:19,177 --> 02:24:20,979
Just do it!

2130
02:24:40,899 --> 02:24:43,401
<i>Uh, is anyone else
seeing this?</i>

2131
02:24:57,349 --> 02:24:58,448
I got this!

2132
02:24:58,450 --> 02:25:00,749
I got this.
Okay, I don't got this.

2133
02:25:00,751 --> 02:25:02,017
<i>Help, somebody help!</i>

2134
02:25:02,019 --> 02:25:04,122
Hey, Queens, heads up!

2135
02:25:13,964 --> 02:25:15,199
Hang on. I got you, kid.

2136
02:25:18,703 --> 02:25:20,168
Hey!
Nice to meet you...

2137
02:25:20,170 --> 02:25:22,039
Oh, my God!

2138
02:25:58,042 --> 02:26:00,242
What the hell is this?

2139
02:26:00,244 --> 02:26:01,710
Friday,
what are they firing at?

2140
02:26:01,712 --> 02:26:03,547
<i>Something just
entered the upper atmosphere.</i>

2141
02:26:16,760 --> 02:26:19,095
Oh, yeah!

2142
02:26:38,816 --> 02:26:41,351
Danvers,
we need an assist here.

2143
02:26:49,958 --> 02:26:52,628
Hi, I'm Peter Parker.

2144
02:26:53,329 --> 02:26:54,795
Hey, Peter Parker.

2145
02:26:54,797 --> 02:26:56,197
You got something for me?

2146
02:27:02,037 --> 02:27:04,307
I don't know how you're gonna
get it through all of that.

2147
02:27:05,842 --> 02:27:07,377
Don't worry.

2148
02:27:08,276 --> 02:27:09,945
She's got help.

2149
02:29:57,610 --> 02:30:01,213
I am inevitable.

2150
02:30:21,333 --> 02:30:22,833
And I...

2151
02:30:24,503 --> 02:30:25,637
am...

2152
02:30:29,408 --> 02:30:30,809
Iron Man.

2153
02:32:29,392 --> 02:32:31,693
Mr. Stark?

2154
02:32:31,695 --> 02:32:33,895
Hey!

2155
02:32:33,897 --> 02:32:36,998
Mr. Stark.
Can you hear me?

2156
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,635
It's Peter.

2157
02:32:39,869 --> 02:32:41,571
Hey.

2158
02:32:42,405 --> 02:32:45,642
We won, Mr. Stark.

2159
02:32:47,309 --> 02:32:49,646
We won, Mr. Stark.

2160
02:32:51,147 --> 02:32:54,381
We won! You did it, sir,
you did it.

2161
02:32:54,383 --> 02:32:56,516
I'm sorry.

2162
02:32:56,518 --> 02:32:57,519
Tony.

2163
02:33:11,067 --> 02:33:12,232
Hey.

2164
02:33:12,234 --> 02:33:14,303
Hey, Pep.

2165
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:19,539
Friday?

2166
02:33:19,541 --> 02:33:22,544
<i>Life functions critical.</i>

2167
02:33:31,019 --> 02:33:32,020
Tony?

2168
02:33:33,223 --> 02:33:34,490
Look at me.

2169
02:33:37,025 --> 02:33:38,961
We're gonna be okay.

2170
02:33:43,732 --> 02:33:45,634
You can rest now.

2171
02:35:30,871 --> 02:35:33,838
<i>Everybody wants
a happy ending, right?</i>

2172
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:36,408
<i>But it doesn't always
roll that way.</i>

2173
02:35:38,278 --> 02:35:40,013
<i>Maybe this time.</i>

2174
02:35:41,480 --> 02:35:44,416
<i>I'm hoping
if you play this back...</i>

2175
02:35:45,952 --> 02:35:48,219
<i>it's in celebration.</i>

2176
02:35:48,221 --> 02:35:52,290
<i>I hope families are reunited.
I hope we get it back.</i>

2177
02:35:52,292 --> 02:35:53,825
<i>And something like
a normal version</i>

2178
02:35:53,827 --> 02:35:56,361
<i>of the planet
has been restored.</i>

2179
02:35:56,363 --> 02:35:58,795
<i>If there ever was
such a thing.</i>

2180
02:35:58,797 --> 02:36:02,766
<i>God, what a world.
Universe, now.</i>

2181
02:36:02,768 --> 02:36:04,902
<i>If you told me 10 years ago
that we weren't alone...</i>

2182
02:36:04,904 --> 02:36:06,971
<i>let alone to this extent,
I mean,</i>

2183
02:36:06,973 --> 02:36:08,972
<i>I wouldn't have
been surprised...</i>

2184
02:36:08,974 --> 02:36:10,641
<i>but come on, who knew?</i>

2185
02:36:10,643 --> 02:36:13,510
<i>The epic forces of
darkness and light</i>

2186
02:36:13,512 --> 02:36:15,445
<i>that have come into play.</i>

2187
02:36:15,447 --> 02:36:17,348
<i>And for better or worse...</i>

2188
02:36:17,350 --> 02:36:18,949
<i>that's the reality
Morgan's gonna</i>

2189
02:36:18,951 --> 02:36:21,752
<i>have to find a way
to grow up in.</i>

2190
02:36:24,590 --> 02:36:25,689
<i>So, I thought I'd probably</i>

2191
02:36:25,691 --> 02:36:27,057
<i>better record
a little greeting...</i>

2192
02:36:27,059 --> 02:36:30,494
<i>in the case of an untimely death.
On my part.</i>

2193
02:36:30,496 --> 02:36:33,899
<i>Not that death at any time
isn't untimely.</i>

2194
02:36:34,867 --> 02:36:36,400
<i>This time travel thing
that we're gonna</i>

2195
02:36:36,402 --> 02:36:38,235
<i>try and pull off tomorrow...</i>

2196
02:36:38,237 --> 02:36:39,303
<i>it's got me
scratching my head</i>

2197
02:36:39,305 --> 02:36:40,536
<i>about the survivability
of it all.</i>

2198
02:36:40,538 --> 02:36:42,107
<i>That's the thing.</i>

2199
02:36:43,909 --> 02:36:45,943
<i>Then again,
that's the hero gig, right?</i>

2200
02:36:45,945 --> 02:36:47,212
<i>Part of the journey
is the end.</i>

2201
02:36:49,214 --> 02:36:50,347
<i>What am I even tripping for?</i>

2202
02:36:50,349 --> 02:36:51,480
<i>Everything is gonna work out</i>

2203
02:36:51,482 --> 02:36:54,619
<i>exactly the way
it's supposed to.</i>

2204
02:36:58,023 --> 02:36:59,757
<i>I love you 3,000.</i>

2205
02:39:14,524 --> 02:39:17,157
You know,
I wish there was a way

2206
02:39:17,159 --> 02:39:18,327
that I could let her know.

2207
02:39:20,930 --> 02:39:23,032
That we won.

2208
02:39:24,333 --> 02:39:26,102
We did it.

2209
02:39:29,572 --> 02:39:31,606
She knows.

2210
02:39:36,312 --> 02:39:38,380
They both do.

2211
02:39:47,356 --> 02:39:48,555
<i>How you doing, squirt?</i>

2212
02:39:48,557 --> 02:39:49,689
Good.

2213
02:39:49,691 --> 02:39:51,091
- You good?
- Mm-hmm.

2214
02:39:51,093 --> 02:39:54,394
- Good. You hungry?
- Mm-hmm.

2215
02:39:54,396 --> 02:39:55,397
What do you want?

2216
02:39:56,165 --> 02:39:57,699
Cheeseburgers.

2217
02:40:02,137 --> 02:40:04,871
You know, your dad
liked cheeseburgers.

2218
02:40:04,873 --> 02:40:06,207
Okay.

2219
02:40:08,676 --> 02:40:09,809
I'm gonna get you

2220
02:40:09,811 --> 02:40:11,210
all the cheeseburgers
you want.

2221
02:40:11,212 --> 02:40:12,213
Okay.

2222
02:40:29,030 --> 02:40:30,563
So...

2223
02:40:30,565 --> 02:40:33,166
when can we
expect you back?

2224
02:40:34,369 --> 02:40:36,435
Um, about that...

2225
02:40:36,437 --> 02:40:38,703
Thor, your people
need a king.

2226
02:40:38,705 --> 02:40:40,807
No, they already have one.

2227
02:40:42,709 --> 02:40:43,911
That's funny.

2228
02:40:49,384 --> 02:40:51,252
Are you being serious?

2229
02:40:54,788 --> 02:40:57,657
It's time for me
to be who I am...

2230
02:40:57,659 --> 02:41:00,328
rather than
who I'm supposed to be.

2231
02:41:01,563 --> 02:41:03,862
But you, you're a leader.

2232
02:41:03,864 --> 02:41:05,832
That's who you are.

2233
02:41:08,035 --> 02:41:10,135
You know, I'd make
a lot of changes around here.

2234
02:41:10,137 --> 02:41:12,070
I'm counting on it...

2235
02:41:12,072 --> 02:41:13,473
Your Majesty.

2236
02:41:23,584 --> 02:41:24,952
What will you do?

2237
02:41:25,552 --> 02:41:27,018
I'm not sure.

2238
02:41:27,020 --> 02:41:29,321
For the first time
in a thousand years,

2239
02:41:29,323 --> 02:41:30,789
I have no path.

2240
02:41:30,791 --> 02:41:32,457
I do have a ride though.

2241
02:41:32,459 --> 02:41:34,492
Move it or lose it,
hairbag.

2242
02:41:38,831 --> 02:41:40,831
Oh, here we are!

2243
02:41:40,833 --> 02:41:42,469
Tree, good to see you.

2244
02:41:46,939 --> 02:41:50,709
The Asgardians of the Galaxy
back together again.

2245
02:41:50,711 --> 02:41:52,812
Where to first?

2246
02:41:53,714 --> 02:41:55,247
Hey.

2247
02:41:55,249 --> 02:41:57,549
Just so you know,
this is my ship still.

2248
02:41:57,551 --> 02:41:58,983
I'm in charge.

2249
02:41:58,985 --> 02:42:01,752
I know. I know.
Of course you are.

2250
02:42:01,754 --> 02:42:03,455
Of course.

2251
02:42:05,891 --> 02:42:08,660
See, you say, "Of course,"
but then you touch the map.

2252
02:42:08,662 --> 02:42:09,760
It makes you think
that maybe

2253
02:42:09,762 --> 02:42:11,762
you didn't realize
I was in charge.

2254
02:42:11,764 --> 02:42:13,364
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there.

2255
02:42:13,366 --> 02:42:14,498
Quail?

2256
02:42:14,500 --> 02:42:15,634
Okay? I am merely trying

2257
02:42:15,636 --> 02:42:17,034
to be of service
and assisting.

2258
02:42:17,036 --> 02:42:18,335
Quill.

2259
02:42:18,337 --> 02:42:19,470
That's what I said.

2260
02:42:19,472 --> 02:42:21,805
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

2261
02:42:21,807 --> 02:42:23,309
Sounds fair.

2262
02:42:25,911 --> 02:42:28,545
- It's not necessary, okay?
- It's not.

2263
02:42:28,547 --> 02:42:29,613
I got some blasters,

2264
02:42:29,615 --> 02:42:30,981
unless you guys
wanna use knives.

2265
02:42:30,983 --> 02:42:33,484
Oh, yes!
Please, use knives.

2266
02:42:33,486 --> 02:42:34,685
Yeah. Knives.

2267
02:42:34,687 --> 02:42:36,322
I am Groot.

2268
02:42:42,128 --> 02:42:43,360
Not necessary.

2269
02:42:43,362 --> 02:42:45,061
There shall be
no knifing one another.

2270
02:42:45,063 --> 02:42:48,267
Everybody knows
who's in charge.

2271
02:42:51,737 --> 02:42:53,104
Me.

2272
02:42:54,172 --> 02:42:55,040
Right?

2273
02:42:55,775 --> 02:42:58,341
Yes, you.

2274
02:42:58,343 --> 02:43:00,810
Of course! Of course.

2275
02:43:00,812 --> 02:43:02,548
Of course.

2276
02:43:04,349 --> 02:43:06,650
Remember...

2277
02:43:06,652 --> 02:43:07,884
you have to return the stones

2278
02:43:07,886 --> 02:43:09,018
to the exact moment
you got 'em...

2279
02:43:09,020 --> 02:43:10,086
or you're gonna open up

2280
02:43:10,088 --> 02:43:12,522
a bunch of nasty
alternative realities.

2281
02:43:12,524 --> 02:43:13,956
Don't worry, Bruce.

2282
02:43:13,958 --> 02:43:16,492
Clip all the branches.

2283
02:43:16,494 --> 02:43:18,296
You know, I tried.

2284
02:43:19,331 --> 02:43:21,597
When I had the gauntlet,
the stones,

2285
02:43:21,599 --> 02:43:23,902
I really tried
to bring her back.

2286
02:43:26,938 --> 02:43:28,839
I miss her, man.

2287
02:43:29,140 --> 02:43:30,141
Me too.

2288
02:43:34,012 --> 02:43:36,548
You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

2289
02:43:39,016 --> 02:43:41,016
You're a good man, Sam.

2290
02:43:41,018 --> 02:43:42,853
This one's on me, though.

2291
02:43:47,024 --> 02:43:49,159
Don't do anything stupid
till I get back.

2292
02:43:50,829 --> 02:43:52,160
How can I?

2293
02:43:52,162 --> 02:43:54,198
You're taking
all the stupid with you.

2294
02:44:01,673 --> 02:44:03,806
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2295
02:44:03,808 --> 02:44:05,409
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

2296
02:44:12,717 --> 02:44:14,549
How long
is this gonna take?

2297
02:44:14,551 --> 02:44:17,554
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2298
02:44:22,626 --> 02:44:23,959
You ready, Cap?

2299
02:44:23,961 --> 02:44:26,497
All right, we'll meet you
back here, okay?

2300
02:44:27,231 --> 02:44:28,332
You bet.

2301
02:44:29,733 --> 02:44:31,402
Going quantum.
Three...

2302
02:44:31,869 --> 02:44:32,935
two...

2303
02:44:33,470 --> 02:44:34,638
one.

2304
02:44:36,540 --> 02:44:38,707
And returning in five...

2305
02:44:38,709 --> 02:44:39,808
four...

2306
02:44:39,810 --> 02:44:41,810
three, two...

2307
02:44:41,812 --> 02:44:43,280
one.

2308
02:44:50,487 --> 02:44:51,453
Where is he?

2309
02:44:51,455 --> 02:44:53,555
I don't know. He blew
right by his time stamp.

2310
02:44:53,557 --> 02:44:55,124
He should be here.

2311
02:45:00,530 --> 02:45:01,630
Get him back.

2312
02:45:01,632 --> 02:45:02,831
- I'm trying.
- Get him the hell back.

2313
02:45:02,833 --> 02:45:04,902
- Hey, I said I'm trying.
- Sam.

2314
02:45:28,724 --> 02:45:30,393
Go ahead.

2315
02:45:48,376 --> 02:45:49,177
Cap?

2316
02:45:51,446 --> 02:45:53,248
Hi, Sam.

2317
02:45:56,051 --> 02:45:59,287
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2318
02:46:01,189 --> 02:46:05,260
Well, after I put the stones
back, I thought...

2319
02:46:06,361 --> 02:46:08,027
maybe...

2320
02:46:08,029 --> 02:46:13,068
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

2321
02:46:14,870 --> 02:46:17,172
How'd that work out
for ya?

2322
02:46:19,574 --> 02:46:21,109
It was beautiful.

2323
02:46:22,177 --> 02:46:24,277
Good. I'm happy for you.

2324
02:46:24,279 --> 02:46:25,313
Truly.

2325
02:46:25,914 --> 02:46:27,349
Thank you.

2326
02:46:28,416 --> 02:46:29,949
Only thing
bumming me out...

2327
02:46:29,951 --> 02:46:31,684
is the fact I have
to live in a world

2328
02:46:31,686 --> 02:46:33,622
without Captain America.

2329
02:46:34,088 --> 02:46:35,423
Oh.

2330
02:46:37,459 --> 02:46:40,294
That reminds me.

2331
02:46:48,703 --> 02:46:50,070
Try it on.

2332
02:47:15,496 --> 02:47:17,097
How does it feel?

2333
02:47:19,366 --> 02:47:21,335
Like it's someone else's.

2334
02:47:24,371 --> 02:47:25,506
It isn't.

2335
02:47:38,786 --> 02:47:40,454
Thank you.

2336
02:47:42,022 --> 02:47:43,456
I'll do my best.

2337
02:47:48,762 --> 02:47:50,698
That's why it's yours.

2338
02:47:52,298 --> 02:47:53,767
You wanna tell me
about her?

2339
02:48:00,440 --> 02:48:02,173
No.

2340
02:48:02,175 --> 02:48:04,477
No, I don't think I will.

2341
02:49:07,498 --> 02:49:12,498
